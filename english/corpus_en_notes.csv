0,0,Virginia man arrested in fatal DUI crash in West Virginia,Haiti’s leader marks independence day amid security concerns,"MARTINSBURG, W.Va. — A suspected drunken driver was arrested in a New Year’s Day highway crash that killed another motorist in West Virginia, police said.

The accident occurred early Wednesday along southbound Interstate 81 in Berkeley County, The Journal reported.

Cody Wade Braithwaite, 32, of Winchester, Virginia, was charged with DUI with death, fleeing DUI, and being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm and a fugitive from justice, Berkeley County Sheriff Curtis Keller said.

Keller said a deputy investigating calls about a reckless driver attempted to make a traffic stop, but the suspect’s vehicle sped up and hit a car, which then struck a guardrail. The driver of the car was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver’s name was not immediately released.

The suspect’s vehicle also hit a deputy’s cruiser before being stopped, Keller said.

Braithwaite was being held without bond in the Eastern Regional Jail. It wasn’t immediately known whether Braithwaite has an attorney.

Moïse, whose government has been accused of corruption, denounced graft during his speech at the National Palace in Port-au-Prince and urged Haiti’s elite to work with the government and help create employment.

“We’re still extremely poor,” he said. “Those who continue to get rich find it normal that they do not pay taxes, find it normal that there can be no competition, find it normal that they set prices for consumers, especially when this consumer is the state itself.”

Moïse also apologized for the country’s ongoing power outages and renewed his 2016 campaign pledge to provide electricity 24 hours a day, saying it was harder to accomplish than he imagined.

The speech that marked the 216th anniversary of the world’s first black republic was originally slated to take place in the northern coastal town of Gonaives, where Jean-Jacques Dessalines declared Haiti’s independence. But the town, like many others, was hit by violent protests that began in September amid anger over corruption, fuel shortages and dwindling food supplies as opposition leaders and supporters demanded the resignation of Moïse. More than 40 people have been killed and dozens injured.

Large-scale protests in Port-au-Prince have since dissipated, although smaller ones are still occurring elsewhere in the country. On Wednesday, opposition leaders and supporters gathered in Gonaives to attend the funeral of an anti-government protester and then carried his coffin through the streets as more protesters joined them.

Pin 11 Shares

(NEWS ROOM GUYANA) — Three persons are currently hospitalized in a serious condition following an accident on the Crabwood Creek Public Road on New Year’s morning.

According to information received, motorcar PNN 7976 driven by 22-year-old Seeram Ramdat was speeding when it collided with a utility pole, injuring the driver and two passengers.

The News Room understands that while driving over the Blackwater Creek Bridge, Ramdat lost control of the vehicle which turned turtle and careened about 200 feet away before crashing into the utility pole and coming to a halt on a resident’s bridge.

The two occupants, 32-year-old Keron Phillips and 45-year-old Ramnand Kishwar were removed from the wreck in semi-conscious states and rushed to the Skeldon hospital.

The driver fled the scene and was subsequently apprehended at his Lot 80 Grant 1718 Crabwood Creek home in a traumatic state. He was also taken to the Skeldon Hospital where he is admitted in a stable condition.

The News Room understands that the vehicle is owned by an elderly woman, and Ramdatt took it without her knowledge.

Police Commissioner Leslie James on Wednesday disclosed that there has been an 8% increase in road fatalities in 2018.

( 0 ) ( 0 )","BERLIN - A fire at a zoo in western Germany in the first minutes of 2020 killed more than 30 animals, including apes, monkeys, bats and birds, authorities said. Police said the fire may have been caused by sky lanterns launched to celebrate the new year.

Several witnesses reported that they had seen the cylindrical paper lanterns with little fires inside flying in the night sky shortly after midnight Wednesday near the Krefeld zoo, Gerd Hoppmann, the city’s head of criminal police told reporters.

“People reported seeing those sky lanterns flying at low altitude near the zoo and then it started burning,” Hoppmann said.

Police and firefighters received the first emergency calls at 12:38 a.m.

The zoo near the Dutch border said that the entire ape house burned down and more than 30 animals, including five orangutans, two gorillas, a chimpanzee and several monkeys, as well as fruit bats and birds, were killed.

Only two chimpanzees could be rescued from the flames by firefighters. They suffered burns but are in stable condition, zoo director Wolfgang Dressen said.

“It’s close to a miracle that Bally, a 40-year-old female chimpanzee, and Limbo, a younger male, survived this inferno,” Dressen said, adding that many animal handlers were in shock at the devastation.

“We have to seriously work through the mourning process,” Dressen said. “This is an unfathomable tragedy.”

The zoo director also said than many of the dead animals were close to extinction in the wild.

The zoo said that in addition to the two rescued chimpanzees, the Gorilla Garden near to the Ape House didn’t go up in flames and that gorilla Kidogo and six other members of his family group are alive.

Criminal police officer Hoppmann said that the use of sky lanterns is illegal in Krefeld and most other parts of Germany and asked that the people who launched them or people who witnessed anything should come forward to police.

Germans usually welcome in the new year with fireworks at midnight and private persons are allowed to buy and launch fireworks. Sky lanterns, however, are both illegal and uncommon in Germany.

Sky lanterns, which are sometimes also called Chinese lanterns, are a sort of hot-air balloon made of paper. They have been used in Asia for celebratory events for centuries.

Hoppmann said investigators found some used lanterns on the ground that hadn’t burned entirely. They were 34 centimetres (13.4 inches) long, made out of white paper with an opening at the bottom where a small fire would have been suspended. The fire heats the air inside, making them fly and shine at night.

2,2,Trump Brings In 2020 At Mar-a-Lago: ‘We’re Going To Have A Great Year’,"Trump says he does not expect war with Iran, ‘likes peace’","(Breitbart) – President Donald Trump welcomed guests to Mar-a-Lago for a New Year’s Eve party on Tuesday evening, predicting great things for 2020.

“We’re going to have a great year, I predict,” Trump said. “I think it’s going to be a fantastic year.”

The president noted the record year for the American economy, predicting even better economic news.

“I think we’re really set for additional growth and jobs and everything else,” he said. “It’ll be great.”

The president answered questions about the ongoing conflict in Iraq after the American embassy in Baghdad was beset by protesters and American Marines responded.

“They were there instantaneously, as soon as we heard,” he said. “I used the word ‘immediately’; they came immediately. And it’s in great shape, as you know.”

He compared the recent attacks to the devastating attacks in Benghazi in 2012, noting that he would never stand for similar results.

“This will not be a Benghazi. Benghazi should never have happened,” he said. “This will never, ever be a Benghazi.”

The president warned Iran from continuing to back militia attacks in Iraq but dismissed the idea that the United States was going to war with Iran.

“I want to have peace. I like peace,” he said. “And Iran should want peace more than anybody. So I don’t see that happening.”

The president also spoke about the impeachment effort led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

“I think the impeachment thing — I call it impeachment light,” he said. “It’s a disgrace. And Nancy Pelosi should be ashamed of herself. She’s a highly overrated person. I know her well; she’s highly overrated.”

Trump said he looked forward to an impeachment trial in the Senate.

“As far as I’m concerned, I’d be very happy with the trial because we did nothing wrong,” he said.

The president even wished the press a Happy New Year.

“I want you to have a great year. Look, you’re honorable people. You have to stay honorable,” he said. “If you’re honorable, I’m going to win the election by a lot. If you’re not honorable, I’m just going to win the election by a little. So I’d rather have you be honorable, okay?”

When First Lady Melania Trump was asked about her hopes for the New Year, she replied, “Peace on the world.”

President Trump agreed but said he would not reveal his New Year’s resolution.

“I’m not sure you’re supposed to say resolutions out loud, okay?” he said. “So we don’t want to. I don’t want to say what my resolution is because I think we jinx it, all right?”

“I like peace,” the president said before heading in to New Year’s celebrations.

The president spoke after Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that around 750 troops from a rapid response unit of the 82nd Airborne Division are prepared to deploy over the next several days to the Middle East.

The US had already flown a rapid response team of Marines into Baghdad to reinforce its embassy after the attack Tuesday, which left smoke and flames rising from the compound’s entrance and further heightened tension between Tehran and Washington.

US officials said there were no plans to evacuate the mission, and no US personnel were reported injured.

The US reinforcements “got in there very quickly,” Trump said.

“I think it’s been handled very well.”

He added that “this will not be a Benghazi,” a reference to an attack in 2012 by radical Islamists on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

The all-stock deal is likely to push Zomato to the top position in India's food delivery market, ahead of Swiggy, which counts China's Tencent Holdings as an investor. Zomato - valued at around $3 billion (roughly Rs. 21,300 crores) after raising money from Alibaba affiliate Ant this month - said Uber Eats in India will discontinue operations, and direct restaurants, delivery partners and users to the Zomato platform from Tuesday.

""India remains an exceptionally important market to Uber and we will continue to invest in growing our local Rides business,"" said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive officer.

Uber Eats in India accounted for 3 percent of the business' gross bookings globally, but more than a quarter of its adjusted EBITDA loss in the first three quarters of 2019, the U.S. ride-hailing firm said.

Uber Eats, which also pulled out of South Korea earlier this year, said it will continue to operate in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

While this is the first large acquisition in the Indian online food delivery market, deal activity has been heating up globally.

Earlier this month Dutch firm Takeaway.com pipped investment company Prosus to buy Britain's Just Eat for 6.2 billion pounds ($8.1 billion). In December, Germany's Delivery Hero agreed to buy South Korea's top food delivery app owner Woowa Brothers for $4 billion.

The report by Google and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) revealed that variety in cuisines (35 percent) was one of the top reasons for recurrent use of online food ordering apps, followed by good discounts and convenience.

""Food tech has now made its presence in greater than 500 cities in India and with consumer confidence growing, there are new opportunities for the players to 'win with the consumer' in an evolving market,'"" said Roma Datta Chobey, Director-Travel, BFSI, Classifieds, Gaming, Telco & Payments, Google.

Peer or network advocacy (52 percent) played a critical role in drawing people to try online food ordering for the first time.

This was followed by advertisements (19 percent) that emerged to be a strong driver in metros and among the higher income groups across the country.

""Overall online spending in India is rising rapidly and expected to grow at 25 percent over the next five years to reach over $130 billion,"" said Rachit Mathur, Managing Director and Partner, India Lead of BCG's Consumer & Retail Practice.

""Riding on the wave of rapid digitisation and steadily growing consumption, the reach of Food Tech companies has grown six times over the last couple of years and will continue to increase further,"" Mathur added.

Zomato and Swiggy currently dominate the online food delivery market in India. Zomato last week announced it has acquired rival Uber Eats food delivery business in India in an all-stock deal of nearly $350 million and Uber will have 9.99 percent stake in the Deepinder Goyal-led food delivery platform.

The Google-BCG report also suggested that consumers have common impediments that hinder adoption.

A fifth of the respondents stated a lack of trust in the app as the main barrier to usage.

Delivery charges (18 percent), food quality concerns (13 percent) and lack of customisation (10 percent) are other reasons why customers have, so far, not experimented with online food ordering.

""Interestingly, these observations vary based on the maturity of the market. While delivery charges is the top reason for not ordering food online in metro cities; in Tier I cities, lack of trust in apps (29 percent) is the primary roadblock,"" the findings showed.

""Food tech startups have revolutionised the way Indians eat. Ordering food online is now a habit. There is large headroom to increase reach, engagement and usage frequency for food tech apps,"" said Abheek Singhi, Senior Partner and Managing Director at Boston Consulting Group.

4,4,"India approves third moon mission, months after landing failure",India targets new moon mission in 2020,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - India has approved its third lunar mission months after its last one failed to successfully land on the moon, its space agency said on Wednesday, the latest effort in its ambitions to become a low-cost space power.

The Chandrayaan-3 mission will have a lander and a rover, but not an orbiter, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman K. Sivan told reporters at its headquarters in Bengaluru, according to an official telecast.

The Chandrayaan-2 mission in September successfully deployed a lunar orbiter that relays scientific data back to earth, but was unable to place a rover on the lunar surface after a ""hard"" landing.

That mission had aimed to land on the south pole of the moon, where no other lunar mission had gone before. The region is believed to contain water as craters in the region are largely unaffected by the high temperatures of the sun.

ISRO had hoped to confirm the presence of water in the form of ice, first detected on its mission in 2008.

Chandrayaan-3 will have a ""similar configuration"" as the previous mission, Sivan said.

Only the United States, Russia and China have landed on the moon. Beijing's Chang'e-4 probe touched down on the far side of the moon last year, while Israel made an unsuccessful attempt to land its Beresheet spacecraft on the moon in April 2019.

India's third lunar mission will likely launch in 2020 and will cost less than its previous mission, the PTI news agency reported on Tuesday, citing Jitendra Singh, junior minister for the department of space.

Sivan also said ISRO was making ""good progress"" for its human space-flight mission slated for late 2021, adding that four astronauts had been picked for training, which will be planned later this month. The project, called Gaganyaan, would cost less than 100 billion rupees ($1.4 billion), the government said in 2018.

India has developed a reputation for pioneering affordable satellite launches and space missions. Its unmanned Mars mission in 2014 cost just $74 million, less than the budget of the Hollywood space blockbuster ""Gravity"".

Sivan also announced that ISRO had begun the land acquisition process for a second spaceport in the southern port city of Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu state.





(Reporting by Sachin Ravikumar; Editing by Kim Coghill)","BANGALORE: India plans to make a fresh attempt to land an unmanned mission on the moon in 2020 after a failed bid last year, the head of the country's space programme said on Wednesday (Jan 1).

Work is going ""smoothly"" on the Chandrayaan-3 mission to put a rover probe on the moon's surface, Indian Space Research Organisation chairman K. Sivan told a press conference.

""We are targeting the launch for this year but it may spillover to next year,"" Sivan said. Indian sources said authorities had set November as a provisional target for launch.

India seeking to become only the fourth nation after Russia, the United States and China to put a mission on the moon's surface and boost its credentials as a low-cost space power.

The country's Chandrayaan-2 module crash-landed on the moon's surface in September.

Sivan said the new propulsion module, lander and surface rover would cost about US$35 million, with a significantly higher outlay for the launch itself.

5,5,Wiesenthal Center Calls for FBI Task Force to Deal with Anti-Semitism,Jewish Groups React to Monsey Stabbings,"The Simon Wiesenthal Center called on the White House to direct the FBI to form a task force to focus exclusively on anti-Semitism following the stabbings in Monsey, N.Y.

Wiesenthal Center founder and Dean Rabbi Marvin Hier and Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action Agenda said in a Dec. 28 statement, “Enough is enough! Jews should not have to fear for their lives in America to go to their houses of worship. The FBI must step up and take the lead in all recent violent hate crimes targeting religious Jews.”

Hier told the Journal in a phone interview that the Dec. 28 Monsey stabbings that resulted in five injured reminded him of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. “Jews were beaten up on the corner. Windows were broken … that’s how it started,” Hier said. “And the population centers tolerated it. Nobody spoke out against it; we didn’t have a plan against it.”

He argued that the rise of anti-Semitism in the United States has become such an epidemic that more action is needed beyond statements and pledges from state and local politicians and police officers. “They’re all good people, but they’re not 24/7 on this job,” Hier said. “They have other jobs. Even police, they have traffic issues. … There are so many issues besides the issue of anti-Semitism [that they have to deal with].”

Hier added that it’s important to ensure that politics doesn’t interfere with addressing anti-Semitism. “When you have a Democratic mayor and a Republican governor or vice versa, it’s a different attitude,” Hier said. “It’s just not the right way to handle an epidemic.”

“We need the FBI to create a special unit focusing 24/7, 365 days a year on one subject: anti-Semitism.” — Marvin Hier

He also argued that people shouldn’t expect anti-Semitism to dissipate with the election of a new president or a new Congress. “When the whole world is affected by the epidemic called anti-Semitism — and this has happened in Europe for the last 15 years — you cannot legitimately argue that the cause of it in the United States is due to one man,” Hier said without naming President Donald Trump.

An FBI task force that is exclusively focused on handling anti-Semitism is therefore necessary to address the rising anti-Semitism throughout the country, he argued. “We need the FBI to create a special unit focusing 24/7, 365 days a year on one subject: anti-Semitism,” Hier said. “That’s the only way that the anti-Semites will wake up because basically they’re going to be targeted, they’re going to be analyzed.”

Hier gave a hypothetical of how the task force would handle an anti-Semitic incident. “Let’s say there’s an attack here in Los Angeles,” he said. “First thing that happens is that everything about the attack is sent immediately to the FBI task force on anti-Semitism. And they become the lead agency. They take over immediately.”

Hier said that the Wiesenthal Center has been in contact with the White House about its proposal for a task force.

“President Trump is aware of it,” Hier said. “He’s been informed of it. … We’ll see what happens. We are pushing very hard. We need bipartisan support.”

Hier urged for a societal unification against anti-Semitism, as he argued that anti-Semitism is emboldened when societies ignore it.

“Society didn’t do the right thing,” he said. “We didn’t recognize that these bigots can return early, and as society, we have to have a program against it, and the program has to unify Democrats and Republicans [and] whatever their political persuasion in Europe. We have to come together to fight this.”","Jewish groups have expressed shock and horror over the stabbings that occurred at a rabbi’s house in the New York City suburb of Monsey, N.Y., on the evening of Dec. 28.

The attack occurred at Chabad of Suffern Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg’s home as he was lighting the candles on a menorah to celebrate the seventh night of Hanukkah. The attacker stabbed five people, including Rottenberg’s son. As of Dec. 30, two of the victims were listed in critical condition and the other three had been released from the hospital.

Grafton Thomas, 37, was arrested on Dec. 29 in connection with the attack. He faces five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary.

Anti-Defamation League New York and New Jersey Regional Director Evan Bernstein told the Journal he was amazed that Rottenberg and the congregants were still praying and singing following the stabbings.

“They were not going to let this horrific incident impact their ability to celebrate that holiday, and I think it shows the resilience of the Jewish community in these moments that are so difficult,” Bernstein said.

American Jewish Committee CEO David Harris condemned the stabbings in a Dec. 29 statement. “We are witnessing a full-fledged epidemic of anti-Semitic attacks in the New York region. In the last week alone, there has been at least one each day,” Harris said. “What we need is a sustained, get-tough, zero-tolerance policy by local and state officials. And that policy must take equally seriously each incident, whatever its source might be. Anti-Semitism is anti-Semitism.”

He also said, “The promising light of this holiday season must defeat the utter darkness of those who commit such violence in the name of hatred.”

Simon Wiesenthal Center Founder and Dean Rabbi Marvin Hier and Associate Dean and Director of Global Social Action Agenda Rabbi Abraham Cooper called on President Donald Trump to direct the FBI to create a national task force to protect Jews from anti-Semitic attacks.

“Enough is enough. Jews should not have to fear for their lives in America to go to their houses of worship,” Hier and Cooper said. “The FBI must step up and take the lead in all recent violent hate crimes targeting religious Jews.”

StandWithUs issued a statement, saying the attack “is yet another urgent reminder of the need to confront anti-Semitism at all levels and in all corners of society. Unfortunately, this rise in anti-Semitism also makes clear that Jews in the U.S. and beyond must invest in serious security, learn self-defense, and work with local allies and law enforcement to ensure their safety.”

Orthodox Union Executive Vice President Allen Fagin called for anti-Semitic acts to be treated as domestic terrorism and praised New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for proposing a law to classify anti-Semitic acts as domestic terrorism.

“This was the ninth anti-Semitic attack in the New York City area in the past week,” Fagin said. “It is the fundamental responsibility of government to protect the safety of all of its citizens. This responsibility must be effectuated with all resources necessary to accomplish this purpose.”

Other anti-Semitic incidents that occurred in New York during Hanukkah included a man punching and kicking a Jewish man while shouting, “F— you, Jew” on Dec. 23, a woman hitting a Jewish woman with a bag on Dec. 26 and a man on Dec. 27 threatening to shoot people at Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters in Brooklyn.

Bernstein told the Journal he has never seen so many anti-Semitic incidents occur in such a short period during his six-year tenure as regional director of ADL New York and New Jersey.

ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt tweeted, “After the hateful assaults we saw this past week in Brooklyn and Manhattan, it is heart-wrenching to see the holiday of Hanukkah violated yet again.

6,6,Big cut on import duty on crude and refined palm oils; Industry says move to hurt domestic refiners,Delhi weather update: Delhiites shiver at 2.4 deg Celsius,"Asserting that India too should protect the interest of farmers like Malaysia and Indonesia, the SEA said Indonesia from January 1 has imposed export duty of USD 50 on CPO and USD 30 on refined palmolien.

The government on Wednesday slashed import duty on refined palmolein from 50 per cent to 45 per cent, while that on crude palm oil (CPO) from 40 per cent to 37.5 per cent with immediate effect, a move that the industry opposed saying it will hurt domestic refiners. A notification in this regard has been issued by the finance ministry.

The duty cut has been made under the ASEAN agreement and the India-Malaysia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (IMCECA), the notification added. Opposing the move, the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India (SEA) said that after the reduction in import duty, the tax difference between CPO and refined palmolein has reduced from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent. “This will have serious impact on domestic palm oil refining industry and oilseeds farmers. We fear import of refined palmolien would increase and capacity utilisation of our industry would be affected leading to potential loss of employment,” SEA Executive Director B V Mehta said in a statement.

After a long time, the domestic oilseeds had started selling their produce above the minimum support price (MSP). “Lower import duty would make it difficult to defend MSP and the new found enthusiasm of the oilseed farmers would be dampened,” he said. The country’s edible oil imports are now touching 70 per cent of the consumption. The duty cut would be counterproductive and contrary to the government’s stated objective of increasing domestic oilseed production, he added. Asserting that India too should protect the interest of farmers like Malaysia and Indonesia, the SEA said Indonesia from January 1 has imposed export duty of USD 50 on CPO and USD 30 on refined palmolien.

Similarly, Malaysia has imposed export duty of USD 31 on CPO and zero duty on refined palmolein which work out to be nearly 5 per cent on CPO value, thus effective duty difference is hardly 2.5 per cent only. “We strongly appeal to the government to increase the duty differential between CPO and refined palm oil to 15 per cent, by taking appropriate measures,” the industry body added.","The air quality recorded at 9.38 am was 433 in the “severe” category.

7,7,The biggest business con of 2019: fleecing workers while bosses get rich,The left’s constant victimhood olympics is a gift to anti-Semites,"From The Guardian

From Boeing to Whole Foods, companies are touting social responsibility as profits soar. Don't believe a word of it

Corporate social responsibility is the second-biggest con of 2019 (Donald Trump remains in first place).

Consider Boeing, whose board just fired its CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, in order ""to restore confidence in the company moving forward as it works to repair relationships with regulators, customers, and all other stakeholders.""

Restore confidence? Muilenburg's successor will be David Calhoun, who, as a longstanding member of Boeing's board of directors, allowed Muilenburg to remain CEO for more than a year after the first 737 Max crash and after internal studies found that the jetliner posed an unacceptable risk of accident. It caused the deaths of 346 people.

Muilenburg raked in $30m in 2018. He could walk away from Boeing with another $60m.

Boeing isn't the only large corporation with a confidence problem. Until his ouster, Muilenburg was a director of the Business Roundtable, an association of 192 CEOs of America's largest corporations. With great fanfare last August, it announced a ""fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders"" (emphasis in the original) and not just their shareholders.

The Roundtable's commitment came in response to growing public distrust of big corporations, and proposals from several Democratic candidates to rein them in.

Another Business Roundtable director is Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors. Just weeks after making the commitment, and despite GM's hefty profits and large tax breaks, Barra rejected workers' demands that GM raise their wages and stop outsourcing their jobs. Earlier in the year GM shut its giant assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio.

About 50,000 GM workers then staged the longest auto strike in 50 years. They won a few wage gains but didn't save any jobs. Meanwhile, GM's stock has performed so well that Barra earned $22m last year.

Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, is another member of the Business Roundtable. Just weeks after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, Whole Foods, an Amazon subsidiary, announced it would be cutting medical benefits for its entire part-time workforce.

The annual saving to Amazon from this cost-cutting move is roughly what Bezos -- whose net worth is $110bn -- makes in two hours. (Bezos's nearly completed DC mansion will have two elevators, 25 bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, and a movie theater.)

GE's CEO Larry Culp is also a member of the Business Roundtable. Two months after he made the commitment to all his stakeholders, General Electric froze the pensions of 20,000 workers in order to cut costs. Culp raked in $15m last year.","Police have arrested a 38-year-old black man from Orange Country, NY, for stabbing five Jews in the home of a Hasidic rabbi in Monsey on the seventh night of Hanukkah. If you’re a New Yorker or a Jew or both, you’re asking why. Why has yet another African-American attacked Jews? Why has black-on-Jewish assault become a continuous feature of life in and around New York? Why now?

The answer: Because the country is seized by the politics of victimhood, and there’s nothing that self-pitying “victims” find easier than blaming Jews for their misery.

The names given to the bogeymen of today’s populism are all historical code words for Jews. On the populist right, this means the elite, the globalists and the media. On the populist left, it’s Wall Street, the wealthy and the 1 percent. If that isn’t enough, the left has also decided that Jews — a minority who make up 2.2 percent of the American population — are “hyper-white” and, in Marxist terms, actually part of the power structure that keeps minorities down.

It’s no secret that right-wing populism has facilitated a violent, sometimes deadly, rise in Jew-hatred, but it’s forbidden to draw similar conclusions about the populist left. At least in public. There are two reasons for this: First, pointing out the problem on the right is a means of attacking President Trump. Second, addressing the problem on the left would mean facing the outsize role that black Americans have played in recent attacks against Jews.

On the first point, it is not only wrong to blame Trump for right-wing anti-Semitism, it’s perverse. How anyone gets away with claiming that the president doesn’t condemn Jew-hatred is beyond me. He condemns it at every turn. He devoted an unprecedentedly large chunk of his last State of the Union address to denouncing anti-Semitism and vowing to fight it wherever it may arise.

Trump recently moved to crack down against anti-Semitism on college campuses (and was denounced for it as a racist by the left). For his commitment to fighting Jew-hatred and his unfaltering support of Israel, he has earned the enmity of far-right anti-Semites.

On the second point, the facts speak for themselves. Throughout 2019, African-Americans attacked Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn on a more-or-less weekly basis, and it barely ever made the mainstream news. It wasn’t until two members of the Black Hebrew Israelites shot up a kosher market in Jersey City in early December that the media was forced into acknowledging reality.

The left’s leading populists have fetishized the victim status of certain minorities, including African Americans. They have made slavery and its legacy the focal points of American life. They have determined, without evidence, that police are on a campaign to kill unarmed blacks. And they speak generally as if we have suddenly been transported to a pre-civil-rights-movement America.

What’s more, unlike Trump, some of the left’s leading populists have gone out of their way to steer their followers toward blaming the Jews. The stand-out figures here are Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Their public record of blaming Jewish money for corrupting American politics is so well-known that it needs no rehearsing here. And it has either been ignored or defended by the larger left. If you called either of them out on their anti-Semitism, you were charged with racism and misogyny. Omar so petrified Democratic leaders that they couldn’t even pass a House resolution condemning her blatant anti-Semitic remarks.

But the problem on the left goes beyond Omar and Tlaib. And it goes beyond the rest of the Squad, who engage in constant anti-Israel theatrics. It stretches to the identitarian populism of most of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president, to the liberal garment-rending over the defeat of the anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn, to the intersectional gobbledygook that divides college campuses by ethnicity, to the Women’s March activists who embrace Louis Farrakhan and down to the community level, where, for example, the NAACP’s Passaic branch posts Facebook rants blaming tainted water supplies on the Jews.

Historically, indulged victims have needed no encouragement in pointing their finger at Jews. Telling them that others are responsible for their woes has usually been enough to get them headed in that direction. But some on today’s left have given Jew-hatred an extra nudge. Their winks, dog-whistles and outright calumnies have served as a noxious propaganda campaign and led to a surge of minority anti-Semitism. With the attempted murders in Monsey, this can no longer be kept a secret, and maybe those who have facilitated it will begin to know a little shame.

The book is an interesting read, even for someone like me, with knowledge of the Soviet and Russian intelligence services operations abroad. The facts I knew from my work and upbringing in the Soviet system are correctly conveyed, and those I didn't know, are interesting and - in many cases - intriguing.

Whether the reader is in the USA, or the UK, or anywhere, they might realize that the authors cover a huge and wide net, spread around the globe.

Perhaps the most interesting parts are those, which provide information, discovered or put together by the authors - that's where they are the strongest narrators.

The Western reader might be more interested in the last chapters of the book, which cover the time after 1999, when Mr. Putin came to power, but I can assure you - the others are also quite interesting, *and* they provide the background for better understanding of today's Russia and Mr. Putin's policies.

Especially of interest for the American readers, in my humble opinion, might be the episodes, describing the financial flows between Russia and the US.

All over the book, and sometimes even between the lines, one could start seeing the origins of the power of today's ruling elite, and the connections it has built with the West.

The governor said he had already done whatever he was supposed to do on the controversial issue.

""Now, it is up to the government (state government) to do the needful,"" Malik told reporters on the sidelines of an event organised by the CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography near here.

Referring to his meeting with the prime minister in mid December, 2019, the governor said, ""I had given the PM a note on Mahadayi (and) after that whatever had to happen has happened, that's all. I don't want to say anything more on it"".

When asked whether the BJP-led state government has spoken to him on the issue, Malik replied in the negative.

Goa and Karnataka are locked in a bitter dispute over sharing the water of the Mahadayi river.

A letter written by Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar to the Karnataka government in October, 2019, in which he reportedly exempted the neighbouring state from taking the Environment Clearance (EC) for a project on the river, had sparked a row.

In another letter on December 18, Javadekar kept his earlier communication in abeyance. However, on December 24, he again informed the Karnataka government that the EC was not required for the project on the river.

""On the issue of Mahadayi, whatever I had to do, I have done. If the government asks for my help, I would offer it...I don't want to talk about it,"" the governor said, adding that Mahadayi has become a controversial issue.

11,11,Spike Island visitor numbers treble in three years,Taoiseach makes first general election campaign pitch in New Year video,"An exhibition outlining the role of Spike Island as a prison during the War of Independence has helped visitor numbers to the island attraction in Cork Harbour treble in the last three years.

According to Cork County Council, which runs the tourist attraction, there were 81,000 visitors to Spike in 2019, marking a 15 per cent increase on the previous year’s figures and ahead of projected growth.

The increase in visitor numbers has prompted Cork County Council to increase access to the island with opening being extended to seven days a week from April to October and weekends in February, March and November.

Spike Island manager John Crotty said that the 15 per cent growth in visitor numbers in 2019 was particularly welcome, especially given some tourist attractions in Ireland saw little growth this year.

“The growth in visitors is above the target set for the island and also saw the site outperform the general tourism market – we welcomed 81,000 visitors in 2019 in what has been a year of conflicting fortunes for Irish visitor attractions.

“While Tourism Ireland say overall visitor numbers to the country were up slightly, a slowing market has seen some sites post flat or negative numbers in 2019, with concern for the UK and European markets in the coming years.

“Brexit, changes in European habits and ‘flight shame’ over concerns of the impact the aviation industry is having on the environment were all said to be contributing to the uncertainty.

Mr Crotty revealed that Spike Island overseas visitors accounted for a greater proportion of the total, rising from 17.5 per cent in 2018 to 21 per cent last year. This was welcome as international visitors are known to spend more than domestic visitors.

He pointed out that the growth in visitor numbers in 2019 followed some important additions including adding a second ferry, procured from the south of France, and a new walk-on pontoon which replaced previous steps in Cobh.

He said the new “Independence” exhibition, telling the story of the 1,400 prisoners held on the island in 1921 during the War of Independence, also opened on the island and proved highly successful.

“In 2020, there are plans to add a covered ticket office at Kennedy Pier in Cobh, a calendar of concerts and events along with a new exhibition telling the story of the Famine-era convicts who did not survive the island prison experience.”

Upward trend

Mr Crotty said that with these new exhibitions and events and an extension of the opening season to seven days a week from April to October, they hope to see the upward trend in visitor numbers continue into 2020.

He pointed out that the former island prison and fortress had only reopened in June 2016, following €6.5 million of investment by Cork County Council and Failte Ireland.

That investment saw the reopening of the Famine-era prison, the 9.7-hectare (24 acre) island fortress, the modern prison, which only closed in 2004, and scenic walking trails around the outer island, as well as a cafe and gift shop on site.

“We currently have a funding application with Fáilte Ireland, with plans to add a social village recreation of island life, a ‘dungeon’-style experience in the fort tunnels and an international welcome hub at the island pier.”

In October 2017, Spike Island was named as Europe’s leading tourist attraction at the prestigious World Travel Awards.

Last November, Spike Island scooped another prestigious award, being named Best Attraction at the International Travel and Tourism Awards 2019 held in London.","Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has made a first general election campaign pitch by promising to help deliver 50,000 new jobs and provide 25,000 new homes in the State this year.

In a New Year video, Mr Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney list Fine Gael priorities for the coming year.

Mr Varadkar says he will steer Ireland through the next phase of Brexit by helping to secure a trade deal between the European Union and the UK; he also vows to give Irish businesses and farmers access to the British market; and promises to “achieve a new record high when it comes to employment”.

“We know that well-paid secure jobs are the best ways to improve living standards, create opportunity, and reduce poverty,” he says.

The Taoiseach’s messages also alludes to climate change, with promises to reduce greenhouse emissions by creating warmer homes, improving air quality and investing in public transport.

The video is the second such broadcast made by the Taoiseach in recent days. On St Stephen’s Day, he described his achievements since assuming office 2½ years ago.

It is one of a number of social media broadcasts and publications recently issued by Fine Gael, suggesting the party is upping the ante ahead of a general election, which is widely expected to take place in the spring.

Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton has also announced a raft of initiatives on waste, packaging and climate change in recent days.

Accra, Jan. 1, GNA - Venadash Institute of Decorative Arts, a private vocational training institution in the Ho Municipality, has graduated 22 women who have completed courses in event decoration, beadwork, cake baking and decoration, and catering.



At its seventh graduation ceremony held at the Global Evangelical Church at Ho Fiave, Mrs Venunye Afi Adugu, Director of the Institute, said the institute, established in 2011, has so far trained 24 batches of students, most of whom had excelled in the National Vocational Training Institute (NVTI) proficiency examinations.

The theme: for the graduation was “Job Creation for the Youth through Skills Acquisition.”

Mrs Adugu said the achievements were because of the efficient and practical teaching by the tutors adding that the graduates were already executing excellent works for their clients.

The Director said the institute had plans to add hat making and fashion design to its line of programmes, beginning next academic year.

Mrs Adugu asked students to take the courses seriously and provide the needed tools and materials for competency-based training.

She said Venadash was on a mission of entrepreneurship development to help address youth unemployment, and advised against truancy, asking parents and guardians not to consider vocational skills training as reserved for school dropouts.

“Vocational and technical skills acquisition requires high intelligent quotient and critical analytical minds to be able to innovate and create. We, therefore, appeal to parents and guardians to desist from discouraging their wards who want to venture into these fields of study. You will never know what the future holds,” she said.

Mr Kenneth Kponor, the Volta Regional Director of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), asked the graduates to make the most of the training and strive to become entrepreneurs and open up employment avenues for others.

He also urged them to encourage their peers to consider vocational skills as a lifeline they could easily access.

The institute was established as the Venadash Training Center, providing skills training in bead making and event decoration.

It was in 2012, transformed into an institute, and adopted the syllabus of the University of Florida, USA, and won accreditation from the National Vocational Training Board in 2015.

It operates faculties of Applied Arts, and Culinary Arts, and runs two programme sessions each academic year.

13,13,Paid leave for new pets offered to Brisbane brewery staff,Dimitrov to ease his way back after injury-hit 2019,"Paid leave for new pets offered to Brisbane brewery staff

Posted

Government benefits ensure new parents are offered paid maternity and paternity leave, and a UK company is now offering its Australian employees a similar scheme when they bring home a new pet.

Key points: A Brisbane brewery is offering ""pawternity leave"" for staff who are new pet owners

The week-long paid pet leave is meant to be an incentive for employees to stay longer

RSCPA Queensland says getting a pet is like bringing a new baby home and it is important to have time to bond

The ""pawternity leave"" scheme is available to staff at BrewDog's Brisbane brewery, which opened late November, company spokesman Calvin McDonald said.

""Pawternity leave is a great benefit that BrewDog can offer its employees worldwide,"" he said.

""Basically it's an extra paid week of leave that you're able to take when you adopt a puppy or get a new puppy in the house.""

Mr McDonald said the perk had been crucial to retaining staff in an industry like hospitality — notorious for its high turnover.

""It means that they don't really want to leave and go anywhere else,"" Mr McDonald said.

While it is an unusual incentive, paid new-pet leave is not completely unheard of in the Australian or international employment market.

The concept has been praised by the RSPCA Queensland, which recommended monitoring pets brought home from their facilities very closely.

RSPCA spokeswoman Nanda Ten Grotenhuis said the first few days could be crucial.

""It's a bit like bringing a new baby home so, you know, you need a little bit of special time for you to bond with that animal to make them feel comfortable,"" Ms Ten Grotenhuis said.

Staff at RSPCA Queensland are not offered ""pawternity leave"", but staff can take sick or carer's leave when their own pet is unwell.

Brisbane mum Kasey Rowland took two weeks annual leave this time last year, when she introduced her new Cavoodle, Raphael, to her young family.

The part-time worker was not entitled to paid pet leave but said she was honest with her employer, who allowed her to take the break and ensure her pet assimilated safely.

""I think it's part of being a responsible dog owner, that you make sure that they're safe and happy and stimulated,"" Ms Rowland said.

""I was a bit worried because for a small dog it's a huge place and he could get into things and get his head stuck in the fence.""

BrewDog has offered the incentive for several years now to its staff internationally.

Sydney-based Pet Circle is another company ensuring its staff are compensated when looking after a new pet.

Lisa Bradley, from the Queensland University of Technology's business school, said it was increasingly common for employers to negotiate flexible working conditions to attract hard-working staff.

""Different types of leave provisions are the most common and being able to work from different locations and at different times,"" she said.

Ms Bradley said it was hard to weigh up the cost benefits for employers who were ultimately pursuing ""increased organisational commitment"".

""That means the person is going to want to continue to work for the organisation and put in their best for the organisation, so sometimes you can't measure the benefits of that directly,"" Ms Bradley said.

The 28-year-old was laid low early in the season and was far from his best after he returned to action, although he did reach the US Open and Paris Masters semi-finals.

Dimitrov said 2019, where he failed to win a title, had been ""quite a journey"".

""It's going to be a year that I remember for the rest of my life,"" he said in Sydney ahead of the inaugural ATP Cup team event, his warm-up for the Australian Open Grand Slam.

""Yeah, the body checks out pretty good right now. I'm still monitoring a lot of my work, a lot that I'm going through.

""I kind of pace myself in the right way. I'm not in a rush, which is also a good thing."" The shoulder problem was Dimitrov's first major injury and he said he plans to limit the number of tournaments he plays, particularly early in the season.

""I'm not going to force myself to play too many tournaments early on and really look after the body. That's the number one thing,"" said Dimitrov, now ranked 20.

""Clearly I haven't competed for almost the past four months of the year, and so that itself brought a lot of doubts, and dropping a lot in the ranking and so on.

""But at the same time, I was able to kind of recover as quick as possible, and hopefully now I'm at a place that can only get better. I'm really going to focus on that.""



He is not only playing for Bulgaria at the ATP Cup, but captaining the team, a new experience that he is relishing.

""It's challenging, no doubt about it,"" he said.

""It's always been a dream of mine to always be kind of on the other end, and I think to be a coach is never easy.

""I don't know if I'm going to be a good coach. I can only share my experience, my thoughts with the guys.""



The ATP Cup, which starts Friday, features 24 nations split into six groups across Sydney, Brisbane and Perth, with eight of them emerging from the round-robin to compete in the knockout phase.

Wekundu wa Msimbazi extend their stay at the top of the top-tier table after a convincing home win

Simba SC opened a 10-point gap on top of the Mainland Table after defeating Ndanda FC 2-0.

The defending champions came into the match as clear favourites having won 10 out of 11 games against their opponents in previous meetings. Being the final game of 2019, Wekundu wa Msimbazi were keen on avoiding surprises and bag maximum points.

Former winger Francis Kahata took only 13 minutes to open the scoring for the 20-time league champions. The hosts won a free-kick about 20-yards from the Ndanda goal; then the Kenyan international curled the ball past the wall and into the back of the net to score his second goal in as many games for his club.

Neither of the two teams could get another goal in the first half despite the numerous chances created especially by the league leaders. Ibrahim Ajib and the returning John Bocco were responsible for missing glorious opportunities for their teams.

Substitute Deo Kanda, who had come on for Francis Kahata, handed the hosts the final blow in the 86th minute when he deflected in a Gadiel Michael shot past goalkeeper Ally Mustapha.

The result took Simba's points tally to 34, 10 more than second-placed Yanga SC. The two teams will play each other on Saturday in the Kariakoo Derby.

Elsewhere, Mwadui FC settled to a 1-1 draw against KMC at Mwadui Complex; the visitors opened the scoring in the 15th minute courtesy of Abdul Hilal before Enock Mkanga equalized in the 70th minute.","Big game right off the bat as we resume league play in 2020. 12-0 Hope at 8-3 Trine on Saturday at 3pm. Hope currently stands as the #1 team in the nation according to Massey and Trine comes in as #23. Hope had a real test against Albion, other than that they have run roughshod thru the 2019 portion of their schedule. Trine with losses to Ohio Wesleyan, #12 Baldwin Wallace and #23 Chicago. They have 2 recent wins over good Ohio Northern and Denison squads and are starting to figure things out with new lineups and substitute patterns.



Both Hope and Trine play a deep bench as both only have 1 double digit scorer. Hope with an outstanding and deep Junior class, whereas Trine has 3 Soph's leading in scoring. The big question at the beginning of the year was how far would Trine regress this year after an outstanding Senior class graduated that led Trine to 3 consecutive NCAA tournaments. This team does not have a ""go to"" player like Dawson who could single handily take over games if needed over her career. We have one Senior, two Juniors, and the rest Soph's and Freshman in the top 11 rotation.



You know Hope is going to pressure the ball and get scores off their defense. You don't see many D3 teams with their length inside either. Our bigs Taylor and Herbert will need to play well and stay out of foul trouble. If were shooting the 3ball decently we'll have a shot to be there at the end, but I am going with Hope by 10+ in this one as they have more experience and playmakers than Trine.",3.5,4.0,1.5,3.5,3.5,4.0,3.0," Wekundu wa Msimbazi extend their stay at the top of the top-tier table after a convincing home win against Ndanda FC .

Moïse, whose government has been accused of corruption, denounced graft during his speech at the National Palace in Port-au-Prince and urged Haiti’s elite to work with the government and help create employment.

“We’re still extremely poor,” he said. “Those who continue to get rich find it normal that they do not pay taxes, find it normal that there can be no competition, find it normal that they set prices for consumers, especially when this consumer is the state itself.”

Moïse also apologized for the country’s ongoing power outages and renewed his 2016 campaign pledge to provide electricity 24 hours a day, saying it was harder to accomplish than he imagined.

The speech that marked the 216th anniversary of the world’s first black republic was originally slated to take place in the northern coastal town of Gonaives, where Jean-Jacques Dessalines declared Haiti’s independence. But the town, like many others, was hit by violent protests that began in September amid anger over corruption, fuel shortages and dwindling food supplies as opposition leaders and supporters demanded the resignation of Moïse. More than 40 people have been killed and dozens injured.

Large-scale protests in Port-au-Prince have since dissipated, although smaller ones are still occurring elsewhere in the country. On Wednesday, opposition leaders and supporters gathered in Gonaives to attend the funeral of an anti-government protester and then carried his coffin through the streets as more protesters joined them.

The Trinamool Congress on Wednesday observed its 22nd Foundation Day as ‘Citizens’ Day’ as a mark of protest against the amended Citizenship Act and pledged not to stop until the “draconian law” is withdrawn. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, also the TMC supremo, congratulated party workers on the occasion and said TMC is observing the day as ‘Nagorik Dibas’ (Citizens’ Day) at the booth-level. “We are observing the foundation day of @AITCofficial as ‘Nagorik Dibas’ (Citizens’ Day) in every booth of #Bangla. We all are citizens and Trinamool will continue to fight for the rights of the people. Jai Hind. Jai Bangla. “#Trinamool22 Today @AITCofficial turns 22.

The journey which began on January 1, 1998 has been full of struggles, but we have been steadfast in our resolve to fight for the people. We thank Maa-Mati-Manush for their constant support. Our workers are our biggest assets,” she tweeted. TMC general secretary Subrata Bakshi said laws are passed to help the people and not to divide the country. “The amended Citizenship Act is anti-people. It wants to divide the country on religious lines. So, if the people don’t accept it, this law has to be withdrawn,” he said.

Claiming that the people of West Bengal have started rejecting the BJP, Bakshi hinted that the party would use the CAA and the proposed country-wide NRC as its main issues in the upcoming municipal elections in the state. Elections to around 107 municipalities of the state including the Kolkata Municipal Corporation are due in April-May this year. The civic polls, in which about 60 per cent voters of the state would be eligible to take part, are being tipped as the ‘mini assembly election’ ahead of the crucial 2021 state polls.

Parties believe that the results of the civic polls will indicate the possible outcome of the assembly elections. Banerjee had last week instructed party workers to conduct various programmes to observe the TMC’s foundation day. The district TMC leaders have organised flag-hoisting programmes and street corner meetings to discuss and highlight the achievements of the state government and speak against the amended Citizenship Act, party sources said. Banerjee, who has been at the forefront in opposing the CAA and nation-wide NRC, has been crisscrossing the state, holding protest marches and rallies against the new citizenship law. On the party’s foundation day, TMC activists also organised blood donation camps in several parts of the state.

The TMC was founded by Mamata Banerjee on January 1, 1998 with an aim to oust the then Left Front regime from power. The party achieved its goal in May 2011 after forging an alliance with the Congress.","Terming the CAA a “targeted” law, she said it is an attack on the Constitution of India. She was present outside the university to participate in a public meeting on the new legislation.

Bollywood actress Swara Bhasker on Wednesday lauded the students of Jamia Millia Islamia for waking up the entire country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which she claimed is a “targeted” law. “We have woken up late but now we have woken up. You have woken up the entire country. We are here to thank you,” she said.

The “federal carbon tax transparency sticker”, which must be displayed on an easily visible place on every gas pump in Ontario outside of a First Nation, was mandated by the Progressive Conservative government last August as a way to convince more Ontarians to oppose the federal carbon tax.

The federal tax was imposed on the province after the Ford government cancelled Ontario’s cap-and-trade program and refused to create a carbon tax of its own.

A baby boy was delivered at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) early Wednesday morning, making him possibly the first baby born in Quebec in 2020.

Little Lucas was born precisely 11 minutes and 49 seconds after midnight.

His mother, Marilou Edger, and his father, Jonathan Beelen, are from Montreal. The newborn and his mother are doing well, according to hospital authorities.

A few moments later, the CHU Sainte-Justine reported the birth of a baby girl at 12:26 a.m.

By mid-morning, no other Quebec hospital had reported a birth since the start of the new year.

In 2019, the first baby in Quebec was born at the MUHC, a girl who was born just two minutes after midnight.

Weighing in at 4.367 kg, Henri was born to parents Amélie Bouchard and Marc-André Baillargeon.

The couple had a feeling their son would be the first born in 2020, ever since the hospital's medical team told them their cesarean section would be scheduled for 11:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve.

""I kept looking at the clocks in the hospital,"" Marc-André Baillargeon said in a phone interview.

Henri was initially due on Dec. 20, but Bouchard's pregnancy ""dragged on"" for 12 days, her husband said.

Bouchard said the hat Henri has been wearing is inscribed with the year ""2020"" and was actually made by hospital volunteers as a gift for the first baby of the year.

Eleven minutes after Henri's birth, Lucas Beelen was born at the McGill University Health Center (MUHC), weighing in at 3.80 kg. The baby's mother, Marilou Edger and father Jonathan Beelen are both from Montreal.

Mathew Barzal is the only representative for the New York Islanders at this year's NHL All-Star Game. If anyone else could join him who would you send?

Like most years, the New York Islanders will have a single representative going to the NHL All-Star game. This year, Mathew Barzal is the Islanders lone ambassador. I know, what a surprise! (Note the heavy sarcasm.)

Of course, Barzal going to be the Islanders representative at the NHL All-Star Game. He leads the team in goals, assists, and points. He's the star of the team and the face of the franchise. He's also dynamic at the 3on3 format of the All-Star game.

Last year, in his first trip to the All-Star festivities, Barzal was the talk of the town. Lining up with Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang, Barzal put up five points in the championship game alone.

After winning last year's 3on3 tournament, Crosby raved about the Islanders youngster and his skill at 3on3 (and 5on5):

""The way he holds onto the puck, the way he skates, 3-on-3, I mean, I don't know if there is anyone better when it comes to holding onto it,"" Crosby said. ""The way he can just beat you 1-on-1, beat you with his speed, hold onto it, you know, watching him out there against the best, and I don't see anyone that really beats him in that category.

Again, it makes sense that Barzal is going. He deserves to go.

But what about other players on the roster? Who else might have deserved to go to the All-Star Game?

I'm stopping short of calling this a snub list because I understand why some of the names I've come up with didn't end up on the final roster. But when I look at the goalies who were selected to the Metro's All-Star team, and that neither one of them are from the New York Islanders, it's clear there's at least one snub.","2019 was a big year for prefab due to increased deregulation of ADUs and growing interest in offsite and modular construction. Cities such as San Jose, California, are using prefab ADUs as possible solutions to their housing shortages. These five prefab houses are top-tier, providing innovative alternatives to more expensive housing. But they’re not just space-saving, practical, and easy to build—they’re stylish as all get-out, from clean, Scandinavian designs to aerospace-inspired prefab cabins.

Whether it’s Kanye’s dome prototypes or Ikea’s plan to design residences for people with dementia, prefab housing of all stripes continued to make headlines in 2019. For our year-end roundup of the best prefabs, however, we’re highlighting the most impressive designs that are available to order.

You’ll notice that a few of these picks are intended as accessory dwelling units (ADUs), which have had quite a year, especially in California, where new laws are making it easier for single-family homes to add a backyard unit. As prefab construction is particularly well-suited for the job, we’ll surely be looking out for more sophisticated, ADU-friendly prefabs heading into 2020 and beyond.

A city-approved modern ADU

In an effort to incentivize more housing stock, the city of San Jose, California, recently pre-approved a backyard dwelling from Bay Area housing startup Abodu so that residents can buy and install one in as little as two weeks. The 500-square-foot house, designed by U.K. studio Koto, costs $199,000 and offers Scandinavian modern style with stark white walls, pale wood floors, and the option to add a curated furniture package.

DENVER -- On a cold Colorado day, Miguel Rivera and Martin Garcia roll up their sleeves and get to work. The two teens were inspired by others on YouTube, and decided to make their own channel dedicated to cleaning up the Earth called 7s Environment.

Invictus, an Orlando-based lawyer, garnered national media attention during his unsuccessful bid to challenge Marco Rubio as a Libertarian candidate in 2016.

During the failed campaign, he claimed he slaughtered a goat and drank its blood as part of a pagan ritual.

He’s also credited by white nationalist Richard Spencer with laying the foundation for the deadly racist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.

Invictus has denied affiliation with Spencer and the racists at the rally, but Spencer credited him with drafting the “tenets” behind the rally.

23,23,Pope Francis denounces violence against women hours after slapping woman's hand away,Pope says sorry for slapping devotee,"Pope Francis has used his New Year's message to denounce violence against women, hours after slapping a woman's hand to free himself from her grip.

"" Women are sources of life . Yet they are continually insulted, beaten, raped, forced to prostitute themselves and to suppress the life they bear in the womb,"" the Pontiff told worshipers gathered at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican on Wednesday.

""Every form of violence inflicted upon a woman is a blasphemy against God, who was born of a woman.""

Shortly before beginning his traditional New Year's Day address , the Pope said he was sorry for smacking a woman's hand the previous day, to free himself from her grip.

""I apologize for the poor example yesterday,"" he said, going off-script before the sermon on violence.

Pope Francis had been making his way to the Nativity scene in Vatican City on Tuesday, New Year's Eve. When he began to walk away from the crowd that had gathered to greet him, video shows a woman grabbing his hand and yanking him toward her.

He became visibly upset, slapping the woman's hand in an attempt to extricate himself. Footage of the altercation also appears to show him shouting at the woman.

Prior to the incident, the woman had made the sign of the cross. She addressed the 83-year-old Pope as she took his hand but it is unclear what she was trying to tell him.

During his New Year address on Wednesday, the Pontiff also spoke about gender equality, telling the congregation that women ""should be fully included in decision-making processes.""

""Every step forward for women, is a step forward for humanity as a whole.""","Pope Francis apologised for ""losing patience"" with a woman who grabbed him on New Year's Eve and later denounced ""all violence against women"" (AFP Photo/Andreas SOLARO)

Vatican City (AFP) - Pope Francis apologised Wednesday for his widely-viewed slap of a woman who had grabbed his hand as he greeted Catholic faithful on New Year's Eve.

The image of Francis slapping his way free from the clutches of the admirer was an instant hit on social media.

A personal apology followed.

""We lose patience many times,"" Francis confessed.

""It happens to me too. I apologise for the bad example given yesterday,"" the head of the Catholic church said before celebrating Mass at the Vatican.

Twitter enthusiasts commented with abandon on the pontiff's prompt riposte to the woman.

Francis had greeted children before the Nativity scene on Saint Peter's square and was turning away when the woman who had crossed herself then cried out something, pulled on his hand and almost caused him to fall.

The 83-year-old pope grimaced before managing to break free by slapping her hand twice.

He continued his tour, walking with some difficulty while maintaining a slightly greater distance from visitors, and gradually relaxed again as he came into contact with other children.

Twitter comments were mostly supportive of the pontiff's instinctive reaction.

""HE IS HUMAN.. Been (sic) a Pope doesn't make you immune to Pain or avoid Reaction to pain,"" one typical comment read.

In his first Mass of the New Year, the pontiff later denounced ""all violence against women"" as ""a profanation of God, born of a woman.""

Francis also said women were ""the source of life"" but deplored that they were constantly ""offended, beaten, abused and forced into prostitution"" and forced to ""supress the life they carry within"" them.

He emphasised that the ""rebirth of humanity began with a woman,"" and bemoaned that women's bodies were ""sacrificed on the profane altars of advertising, profit, pornography.""",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.3333333333333333,1.0,1.0,1.0, Pope Francis used his New Year's message to denounce violence against women .

The trouble is that we have whole audiences caught between stools right now. They're confused about which side to sit on. They're uncertain about what position to take, so they step back and let someone else do their thinking for them. Members of Congress who swallow their consciences to please the system rather than the Gospel are not going to stand for anything. Surely the wealthy who vote for their stock returns and their tax reductions rather than for the upbuilding of the needs of the entire nation are not going to worry about little things ― like somebody else's poverty. And without doubt, average persons who can't tell the political lies from the truth anymore may know what's right in their hearts but have no idea what happened to the congressional process that once decided those things together. So inured are we to alternative facts, competing values, unclear constitutional interpretations, and the difference between national laws and, well, the rise of an imperial presidency, it's impossible to know who knows what. When a ""royal presidency"" ― an oxymoron in itself, like bittersweet or open secrets or living deaths ― suddenly outranks any other law-making force in the country, the people who've been lied to quit believing in facts all together. Now ""facts"" are just one more movable feast. ""They all lie,"" people say of politicians and national agencies and the media and even of the scientists they've been taught to doubt so that corporations don't have to make any ecological changes to their products or processes. Indeed, the people have been taught to doubt, so now government and science are begging us to save ourselves because it is already too late to debate climate change. But how can we save anything while we keep rolling back ecological regulations for the sake of short-term corporate profiteering? How is a nation supposed to trust anyone or any laws at all when the president himself, having declared himself above it, simply deals with the law by refusing to keep it, to honor it, to submit to its review and validation? In the face of that kind of reasoning, tell your teenager that we're a country of laws and hear the laughter in the background. Only this time, it's at you.

In a world such as that, maybe it's just better to keep your head down, many think, and follow the herd rather than risk attention, or worse, risk public disapproval. Do little and say nothing at all has become the new definition of peace and security in a land of political turmoil and working families living in tent cities due to the lack of a decent minimum wage and to the disappearance of low-cost housing. This, while at the same time, they tell us the economy is soaring for some while we're spending money building walls instead of raising the minimum wage to a living wage. I give up: Where's the moderation? In fact, is moderation moral when topics such as those aren't even being discussed and debated in the highest level in government? So much for democracy. We've seen democracies destroyed. But it is just as possible to simply let ours die on the vine from the plague of federal indifference. In a between-the-stools population and political system, being neither hot nor cold has become a fine art. It has its own set of norms, of course: As in, ""Say nothing about what you don't like. Be silent and hope this awful nightmare finally ends. Move over and make room for the white nationalists, the racists, the automatic rifles, the new elected monarchy."" After all, ""there were very fine people on both sides,"" right? The problem? The whole scene has the tone of ""The Handmaid's Tale."" Everybody's lined up, smiling a pasted-down smile, sure that the world can be saved despite the fact that few are saying anything to save it. Like demand gun laws. Like rejoin the Paris climate agreement. Like stop the tariff war. Like impose ecological regulations immediately before the next city is underwater and the poor have no water at all. No, moderation won't do it. What we need now is Christian extremism, the idea that there are some things that cannot be tolerated in life, that there is something we can do to resolve these logjams if we really want to do it. These are the people who are ""either hot or cold."" And Jesus loves them. Christian extremism is extremely concerned about what this era of insult and mockery has sown. We need people who don't change TV news channels because the news ""depresses"" them. Instead they listen carefully to understand what needs to be done and they join mixed groups to start doing it. Locally as well as globally. Christian extremists are extremely open to new ideas. They read good articles carefully. They call for the creation of mixed groups to consider what can be done about issues on a local level. They find out from local officials what can be done to control guns, for instance, and provide medical care, and start subsidized housing, and invest in ecological preservation. They take part in democracy, in other words, as any citizen who wants to keep it must do.","Nowadays, registered investments advisors (RIAs), financial planners, financial advisors, wealth managers, even money doctors are pretty much tossed around and used interchangeably.

AGRA: A 37-year-old bullion trader allegedly killed himself after shooting his wife and two minor children inside his SUV, parked near Vrindavan exit point on Yamuna Expressway early Wednesday morning. While Neeraj Agarwal, his wife Neha (35) and his daughter Dhanya (6), were found dead, his son Shaurya,10, is battling for life at a Delhi hospital.As per documents accessed by TOI, Agarwal was facing multiple inquiries from Income Tax department, commercial tax department and Economic Offences Wing for Rs 123-crore transactions after demonetisation in November 2016. Police say that the Enforcement Directorate was also on his trail and he was under heavy debt. “These could be likely reasons which pushed him to the brink,” they say.His family, however, claimed that Agarwal was killed at the behest of his business rivals. “Some people had shot at Neeraj two years ago in Govardhan area and a police complaint was filed in this regard. Fortunately, he survived as the bullet nicked just his car,” said his father Dinesh Chandra Agarwal. The family is based in Govindnagar area of Mathura but Neeraj, along with his family, was living in Delhi for the past one year.“Neeraj used to come to Mathura frequently. His wife also hailed from Mathura’s Jaganathpuri area,” his father added. He admitted that some inquiries were going on against him. “But Neeraj had filed an appeal in the cases and this this could not be the reason for his death,” he said.Police said that the incident took place early Wednesday morning. While Neeraj’s body was found on the driver’s seat of Tuscon, all other three members of his family were on the back seat and had gunshot injuries on their head. The car was locked from inside. According to SP (city) AK Meena, Neeraj’s son was found breathing when the police broke the glass of the car and he was immediately rushed to Nayati hospital from where he was shifted to Apollo hospital, Delhi, as his condition was critical.Meena told TOI that a small note was also found inside the car and the it had been sent to forensic wing for checking its authenticity. Though the note was not clear, it had a mention of some issues related to custom and penalties. He said, police found a pistol in Neeraj’s right hand and he had apparently shot himself on his right temple.Neeraj’s brother-in-law, Amit, told TOI that his sister, Neha and her family had dinner with them and they all appeared happy. “They had left late on Tuesday night for Delhi as their daughter’s program was scheduled early Wednesday morning,” he told TOI. Amit has filed a complaint in this matter and an FIR is being lodged at police station.In July 2018, the investigation wing of I-T department had conducted a raid at RS Bullion and Jewellers in Mathura, owned by Neeraj Agarwal and Neha Agarwal, and found large-scale anomalies during the period after demonetisation. According to reports, RS Bullion had alone deposited Rs 123 crore cash in bank accounts during demonetisation.After the raid, the I-T officials had told media persons that Neeraj claimed to have sold gold worth Rs 37 crore in a single day, however, records suggested that his firm converted black money of people into white by taking commission. In return, the trader had provided them receipt of gold purchase. Also, the trader, had claimed that he had taken gold stock from a firm in Mumbai — Vanity Jeweller — but it was closed down in 2012, much before demonetisation announced.","Neeraj, his wife Neha with their children.

A businessman, his wife and daughter were found dead in an SUV early Wednesday morning in Mathura. According to police, Neeraj Agarwal (40) allegedly shot his wife Neha Agarwal (36) and two children, a girl aged six and a boy aged 10, before shooting himself. No suicide note has been recovered, said police.

While the couple and their daughter were declared dead on arrival at the hospital, their son has been referred to Delhi’s Apollo Hospital for further treatment and is under observation. Their families, however, have alleged foul play and filed an FIR under IPC Section 302 (murder) at the Jamna Paar police station in Mathura.

Ashok Kumar Meena, SP City Mathura, said: “We received information from a patrol vehicle about four bodies being found in a white SUV, close to the Vrindavan turning near the Yamuna Expressway. They broke open a window and found that the boy was still alive. The others in the car, including a minor, had died due to bullet wounds. Prima facie it appeared that Neeraj shot his family members before killing himself. But we have received an FIR for possible murder, which will be investigated.”

Neeraj hailed from Jagannath Puri in Mathura and ran a bullion trading company in the city. According to his family, Neeraj, along with his wife and children, had been living in Delhi’s Mayur Vihar for the last six months. Police said Neeraj shifted to capital because of work pressure, and was looking after his business from here.

He and his family visited his in-laws in Mathura on Tuesday evening. Around 10 pm, Neeraj said they had to leave for Delhi as there was a function at his daughter’s school. They stopped for dinner at a restaurant close to Expressway, said a family member. Six hours later, their bodies were found in the car which was parked in a service lane close to Expressway.

Initially, police could not spot the bodies as the windows were fogged. When a policeman peered through a crack, he found three people covered in blood while the boy was still breathing. Police suspect the bullet went through him. “There is something odd about the whole scenario; the way they have been shot looks professional. It merits an investigation. Everything was normal when Neeraj left. Even if it is a suicide, we need to find out the truth,” said Tarun Agarwal, Neeraj’s relative.

According to police sources, Neeraj’s company was under the scanner for alleged fraudulent transactions following demonetisation. But family members claimed that a professional rival had planted fake complaints to harass Neeraj. Several notices were issued and the matter is pending in court, he said. Neeraj would even keep a licensed gun with two loaded magazines with him for protection, said the family member.

ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Power Omar Ayub Khan says domestic demand for gas has gone up by almost 20 per cent.

Taking to Twitter on Wednesday, he said apart from CNG stations, all consumers are being supplied gas.

“CNG stations will be provided gas intermittently during January and fully in February,” the minister said, adding record-breaking and extended cold spell has resulted in low pressure across the system, which is expected to improve in a week.

“Country wide we were providing more than 12% extra gas compared to last year December,” he said.

“In SNGPL system, supply to domestic sector was avrage 831mmcfd in December2018. In first 15 days of this month we supplied 30% more. Now we are supplying 47% more to domestic sector,” he added.

According to the Fitness Industry Association, 12 per cent of gym memberships are taken out in January - and most people will have already stopped going withing six months.

And it is easy to see why: gyms can be daunting places for the initiated, full of monstrously heavy weights, bizarre looking machines and muscle-bound athletes pumping iron.

There is also a tempting array of ways to injure/embarrass yourself, all of which often leads to us either not going anymore, or simply cancelling our membership.

Devon Live caught up with former Exeter Chiefs player Sam Blythe, founder of Fitness Matters on Marsh Barton in Exeter, to offer some tips about how to avoid easy mistakes and make sure the gym is for life, not just for Christmas.

1) Too much too soon

""People are often so super keen when they join a gym in January that they are possibly just doing too much too soon. They need to take small steps.

""Some people are coming to the gym after a little while out, but others – with the best will in the world – are not so clued up and maybe take on too much too soon.

""It's much better to start slowly and take your time.""

2)It's good to talk

""It is worth having a chat with a few people, taking your time and getting some advice along the way. That will give you real structure and a plan. Then you are way more likely to keep it going.

""If you are somebody who has spent a lot of time in the gym but just lost a bit of momentum along the way then you probably won’t need any advice, but if you are new then speak to someone.

""Any environment you don’t know is daunting so sitting own and having a chat with someone who works there or a PT for a bit of confidence or guidance to get a nudge in the right direction is no bad thing.""

3) Plan your routine

""I would suggest those people who are new to a gym just give a little bit of thought to what you might do. A lot of people get on the gym floor, don’t know what they’re doing and end up just doing the same few exercises day after day. It pays to sit down the night before and have a think about it so you have a way forward.

""You want to be healthy for ever, not just January.""

4) Warm up...

""A warm-up is always going to help you.

""Make your warm-up specific to what you are going to do. There is no point in warming up a part of your body you are not then going to use.

""It needs to be specific to what you are going to do. If you want to improve your running, you are not going to just jump on a treadmill and start sprinting right away. It just needs a little bit of common sense.

5) ...and cool down

""Cooling down and stretching is often very overlooked. People often don’t do it because it is harder to see the benefits when you are doing it looking in the mirror.

""People often just want to lose weight and look better, but often stretching and cooling down will help you avoid injury and recover more quickly, which means you can spend more time exercising and, in the long run, will look better anyway.""

6) Be patient

""From a technical point of view, it is important not to rush into things without knowing what you are doing first. You could end up injuring yourself or not getting the results you hoped for.

""Mentally, it is just like going on a diet. When you try and change something overnight often it will only last for a week or two and then you get resentful and fall off the wagon and you are back to square one. You want to keep it sustainable, which begins with a steady start to get the snowball rolling.""

7) Find your lifestyle balance

""You have to find a lifestyle that is sustainable to yourself. That is different for everybody – what is a sacrifice to one person isn’t necessarily to another. It is about finding what works for you and sticking to that.""

8) Gym goals

""Different people have different ways of doing it. Some people are very goals-driven, and soon fall off the wagon if they don’t have something to aim for. Other people like just ticking over and staying fit.

""Overall, I think staying healthy is important, but if you can find a challenge to give you that little spike from time to time then that is great.""

9) An all-round approach to exercising

""In my opinion, it is about having the best all-round approach.

""It depends how structured you want to be when you start going to the gym and what your goals are, but the all-round package in terms of exercising and living is very important.

""You don’t have to be the master of everything. If you do 80 per cent of things right, the other 20 per cent will take care of itself.""",4.0,4.0,1.3333333333333333,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.6666666666666665," Federal Minister for Power Omar Ayub Khan says domestic demand for gas has gone up by almost 20 per cent .

27,27,Cop indicted for yanking on ultra-Orthodox man’s sidelock,Indore: Health dept to raise demand for more doctors and staff,"The Justice Ministry’s Police Internal Investigations Department filed an indictment Wednesday against a police officer who is accused of assaulting an ultra-Orthodox man by yanking on his sidelocks in an unprovoked attack as he was arresting him.

The alleged assault on Mordechai Kreuzer in July was caught on camera and published by Hebrew media, leading to a backlash of accusations of police brutality.

PIID filed the indictment at the Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court against Yaakov Sheetrit, who is accused of assault as well as obstruction of justice in the course of the subsequent probe.

Another officer who was also involved in the incident will have his case dealt with by a disciplinary tribunal, Haaretz reported.

The incident happened during a demonstration against the demolition of illegal buildings in the central city of Beit Shemesh, which has a large ultra-Orthodox community.

Sheetrit and other officers told a crowd of protesters to disperse from a parking lot and then allegedly began pushing and shoving them.

At one point their attention became focused on Kreuzer, and Sheetrit allegedly hit him in the face, then dragged him away to a patrol car, pulling him by his sidelock.

During the clash Kreuzer suffered injuries to his face, back, elbow, forearm, shoulder and pelvis.

Sheetrit was also injured, apparently falling over and requiring a cast for his leg. He later claimed that Kreuzer attacked him with punches and kicks and that he was also assaulted by other demonstrators, a claim not borne out by the video evidence.

Kreuzer was initially arrested and charged with assaulting an officer but released after the video came to light. He said that in the hours after his arrest, which happened on a Friday, he was further mistreated by police at the jail and forced to ride in a car on Shabbat.

Sheetrit was suspended from duties after the investigation opened.

At the time, Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan, who had come under fire over accusation of police brutality against Ethiopian-Israelis, called the incident appalling and said he approved of the officer’s suspension.

Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, head of the Haredi political party Shas, said at the time the incident “bordered on anti-Semitism.”","Indore: Struggling with the scarcity of doctors, the health department is preparing a demand letter to fill posts of doctors and staff in the hospitals and health centres in the district.

The demand letter will be handed over to the health minister Tulsi Silawat on January 3 who will put it before the cabinet, which will meet on January 4.

Indore district has about 150 hospitals and health centres and they all have inadequate number of doctors and staff. The most ambitious scheme of state government, Sanjeevani Clinic, too has been adversely affected due to paucity of staff.

According to chief medical and health officer Dr Pravin Jadia, a meeting of all incharge of health centres and hospitals was held on Wednesday to assess the availability of staff.

Sources said doctors are shifted from one place to another for special duties, which affects the routine work in hospitals. As a result, target of various health schemes is not achieved.

The chief secretary had asked for availability of doctors in the state in 2019 but no recruitments took place.

28,28,Nine are killed and thousands more evacuated after floods in Indonesia,Indonesia: Jakarta hit with deadly floods,"Nine people have died after Indonesia's capital was hit by its deadliest flooding in years as torrential rains on New Year's Eve left vast swathes of the city submerged.

Thousands were evacuated to temporary shelters as electricity was switched off in scores of waterlogged neighbourhoods across greater Jakarta, home to about 30 million people, with some train lines and one of the city's airports also shut.

Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency called on residents to leave flood-hit areas. 'The first priority is saving lives,' said agency head Doni Monardo.

A 16-year-old was electrocuted by a power line, while three more people died of hypothermia, according to the disaster agency.

'My son's body was covered with newspaper when my two other children passed by,' said Fadrid, who identified himself as the dead teen's father.

'People asked them whether they knew the victim. If they hadn't been passing by, we wouldn't have known my son had been killed,' he told AFP.

Among the victims was an elderly couple trapped inside their home in a district where floodwaters reached as high as four metres (13 feet) after a river burst its banks.

Another victim drowned while four people were killed after the Tuesday evening downpour triggered landslides in the city's outskirts.

'We have shut down power (in many areas) to avoid more electrical shocks,' Ikhsan Asaad, an official at state firm PLN, told AFP.

Asaad said he could not estimate how many residents had been affected by the power shutdown.

'We're currently focusing on taking measures to ensure people's safety,' he added.

Angelina Widiyanti was among scores of residents whose houses were flooded with their possessions ruined by the disaster.

'We've had flooding several times before but it was never this high,' she said from her home, where the power had been cut.

'We weren't prepared for this.'

Authorities said about 19,000 people were evacuated, but that figure did not include residents in Jakarta's satellite cities.

'We're evacuating people right now,' Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan told reporters.

'Everyone living near rivers should anticipate (more) flooding,' he added.

Images from across the region showed waterlogged homes and cars submerged in muddy floodwaters, while some people took to paddling in small rubber lifeboats or tyre inner-tubes to get around.

The disaster marked Jakarta's worst flooding since 2013 when several dozen people were killed when the city was inundated by monsoon rains.

Jakarta is regularly hit by floods during Indonesia's rainy season, which started in late November.

On Wednesday, service at Halim Perdanakusuma airport, which handles commercial and military planes, was temporarily shut due to severe flooding on its runways, according to the transport ministry.

Many flights were transferred to Jakarta's main Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.","At least nine people died as Jakarta was hit with severe flooding over the New Year.

Torrential rain soaked tens of thousands of revelers as they waited for New Year's Eve fireworks in Indonesia's capital.The rains led to flooding across the city.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said the monsoon rains and rising rivers had submerged at least 90 neighborhoods.

Thousands of people were displaced by flooding and a domestic airport was closed after water levels reached up to 3 meters (10 feet) in several places.

Wibobo said some of the deaths were due to hypothermia, but also included a 16-year-old high school student who was electrocuted by a power line.

Indonesia's state electricity utility said it had switched off power to hundreds of districts to prevent further electrocutions.

Authorities have deployed about 120,000 rescuers to help evacuate those affected and install mobile water pumps. Further flooding is expected with downpours forecast for the coming day.

Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan told reporters his administration would push ahead with infrastructure projects on two major rivers, including a dam and a sluice, to prevent flooding in the city of 30 million people.

This was the worst flooding since 2013 when dozens of people were killed in monsoon rains.

A New Year is upon us and let’s hope it’s without drama.

THE morning after the night before can be a revelation.

For the first time in decades, I woke up yesterday fairly well-rested and without a hangover.

Part of the reason was that, as a member of the dedicated Daily newsroom team, I had a 7am start. So apart from a restaurant dinner and re-run of the movie Jersey Boys, my New Year’s Eve was uneventful.

But I soon realised there was much more to my unusual disinterest in the celebrations.

The past few months, the pages of the Daily and our online space have seen so much tragedy in our neighbourhoods, natural disasters and heartache, I think I am in the throes of emotional fatigue.

I have so much empathy for the strangers who have lost loved ones, seen irreplaceable keepsakes burn in the rubble of their fire-torn homes, and who are valiantly fighting disease or are down on their luck.

I cry for the parents, children and mates who lose loved ones on the roads or to violence in their own homes.

I see vision of the walls of flames firefighters throughout the country are being faced with and there’s nothing I can do to stop it. I see salt-of-the-earth people raising funds for charity, who later find themselves grappling with life-threatening disease. And there’s nothing I can do.

Celebrating life and a new year somehow felt a little off this time. I’m a glass half-full person and personally had a great 2019. But my wish for 2020 is for a boring year — one with fewer dramas for Coast residents, a major cut in the national road toll, no drought or flooding rains. And I’ll raise my early morning coffee cup instead to everyone’s good health and happiness.","Revelers packed the Las Vegas Strip to usher out 2019 and ring in 2020 on New Year’s Eve.

Sikh devotees at a procession on the occasion of Prakashotsava in Patna on Wednesday.

PATNA: Thousands of Sikh devotees on Wednesday participated in the ‘akhand path’ and ‘Nagar Kirtan’ at Gai Ghat gurdwara, which was followed by a ‘Shobha Yatra’ on the second day of three-day 353rd Prakashotsava celebrations to mark the birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh.

The ‘Shobha Yatra’ which started from the Gai Ghat gurdwara at 2.30pm converged at Takht Shri Harmandir Sahib in Patna City late evening. During the yatra, devotees recited ‘Gurbaani’ from the Guru Granth Sahib on the beats of drums.

The band members of several schools including Guru Gobind Girl’s Middle and High School, Guru Gobind Boy’s Middle and High School, Guru Tegh Bahadur Academy and Guru Nanak School as well as orchestra members from Punjab enthralled the audience with their scintillating performances. Gatka (martial arts of Sikh) was also performed by the youths during the yatra.

Members of the gurdwara committee and locals put up stalls of refreshment between Gai Ghat gurdwara and Takhat Sri Harmandir Patna Sahib gurdwara to provide snacks, juice and water to the devotees. Horses, camels and elephants were also included in the procession.

On the occasion of Prakashotsava, all the gurdwaras in the city, including the Takhat Sri Harmandir Patna Sahib gurdwara, Gurdwara Sri Gai-ghat Sahib, Guru Ka Bagh gurdwara and Bal Leela gurdwara have been decked up with flowers and illuminated with lights.

A rush of devotees from India, Canada and Australia was witnessed at various locations in Patna City, including the Kangan Ghat and other gurdwaras. Many devotees also showed active participation in serving ‘langar’ to the people.

Manpreet Singh from Punjab said he along with his family will contribute their best during the three-day Prakashotsava. Another devotee Mahinder Singh, who, after celebrating the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in Rajgir, arrived in the city to attend Guru Gobind Singh’s birth anniversary said, “Since I am a retired man, my wife and I have decided to participate in all such events.”

Daljeet Singh, superintendent of Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Prabandhak Committee said, “Langar was also arranged at Gai Ghat gurdwara for devotees. People of all religious groups have come out on streets to mark the Prakashotsava celebrations. The celebrations will continue till midnight of January 2,” he said.

","Chandigarh (Punjab) [India], Jan 1 (ANI): Punjab Governor VP Singh Badnore in a message on Wednesday called upon the people to rededicate themselves to the ideals and goals set out by Guru Gobind Singh.

Pieter Ijsselstein has produced 600 bars of a peach-scented impeachment soap to inject some humour into the political news coming out of Washington. The U.S. House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump Dec. 18 for abuse of power and obstruction.

Ijsselstein said he went online to find out if anyone was making an impeachment soap, and when he found people comparing the impeachment proceeding to a soap opera, he figured he was on to something.

""There is lots of references to soap so I thought it would be a neat idea to use that word soap and turn it into an impeachment soap,"" he said.

Ijsselstein said the response to the new soap has been good, especially with people looking to buy gifts for relatives who are big Trump supporters.

""My son-in-law actually put a sample of it online and immediately got a sale,"" he said.

Ijsselstein said he isn't political and created the soap as a humorous word play.

There are different processes one must undergo for immigration, that some people get confused with all the to-dos in the checklist and ends up getting stressed about the littlest things. In planning for immigration, there are certain things that you should take note of.

The Immigration Process

Immigration to another country requires a due process that needs to be fulfilled. For countries like the U.S., their immigration process is lengthy and costly. The usual procedure for the immigration process is first, the acquiring of the immigrant visa to be eligible for legal permanent residency.

An immigrant visa can be acquired in four ways (on U.S. standards and legal procedures). These are family-based, employment-based, asylum and refugee status or diversity lottery.

Aside from the immigrant visa, it should be verified that the immigrant has no criminal records to be issued a legal permanent residency.

The processes for immigration can be too complex. Hiring an immigration attorney would not only lessen the burden on you, you can also be assured that the legal processes are duly followed.

As mentioned, the whole immigration process can be a bit complicated. To avoid unnecessary troubles along the way, here are some tips when planning for immigration to another place.

Tips in Planning for Immigration

All requested forms and information should be submitted in advance. Be certain that everything indicated are true and correct.

Be ready for any delays. Submitting the forms in an earlier date will buy you more time for preparation.

You should also have a copy of all the documents you have passed to the authorities.

Be respectful to immigration authorities and be on time if there are scheduled appointments or interviews.

Better to follow all the steps legally. Avoid any shortcut methods to prevent any trouble.

Hire an efficient and competent immigration lawyer. If your situation is complicated or you find the whole process overwhelming, then legal assistance would be needed. Your lawyer must be an expert in immigration cases.

Though the whole immigration process might be tiring and would require much effort, time and money, following these tips might alleviate some of the burden on you. Although the legal processes are important, better be prepared of other things you might encounter a problem with in the future.

Other Things to Consider in Planning for Immigration

You should have at least a brief background or knowledge about the country you are going to.

If the country or place you are planning to move on to speak a different language, better start learning the basics that would be enough for you to survive daily conversations.

Even if the whole process can be tedious, the primary advice for a successful immigration is persistence.",3.333333333333333,3.0,1.25,3.75,4.0,3.5,2.0, The owner of P.E.I.'s Island Potato Soap Company has produced 600 bars of a peach-scented impeachment soap .

32,32,"It’s been rocky at times, but Bitcoin rose 9,000,000% this decade",Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day,"If in the throes of this bull market’s earliest stages of recovery someone told you to forgo stocks, forget commodities, renounce fixed-income assets and buy an unknown digital token, the first of its kind, and watch it grow beyond your wildest dreams, you’d call them crazy, right?

Emerging out of the ashes of the financial crisis, Bitcoin was created as a bypass to the banks and government agencies mired in Wall Street’s greatest calamity in decades. At first, it was slow to break through, muddied by a slew of scandals: fraud, thefts and scams that turned away many and brought closer regulatory scrutiny. But once it burst into the mainstream, it proved to be the decade’s best-performing asset.

The largest digital token, trading around $7,200, has posted gains of more than 9,000,000% since July 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

“Bitcoin really captured that wild technology enthusiasm that ‘this time is different,’” said Peter Atwater, the president of Financial Insyghts and an adjunct professor at William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va.

The performance over the past 10 years, even with its huge run-up and subsequent mega-crash, leaves all others in the dust. It’s a massive windfall for those who — to use the lingo of the crypto crowd — HODL’ed through its ups and downs, even as it continues to provide fodder for get-rich-quick schemes. For some, the never-ending fantasy of continually hitting that payoff still helps to keep Bitcoin’s momentum going.

Nothing else comes even close to beating it. The S&P 500 merely tripled in that period. An index that tracks world markets has more than doubled. Gold is up 25%. Some of the best-performing stocks in the Russell 3000 — including Exact Sciences Corp. and Intelligent Systems Corp. — are each up about 3,000%. Those gains pale in comparison to the finance world’s latest — and one of its most controversial -- marvels.

Partly, the monster return is a reflection of the calculus behind Bitcoin’s jumping-off point: the token wasn’t worth anything when someone named Satoshi Nakamoto launched it on Halloween 2008. Designed as a method of exchange that can be sent electronically between users around the world, it did not have a centralized control network. Bitcoin, instead, is run by a network of computers that keep track of all transactions on the blockchain ledger. For many, that technology was reason enough to buy into the idea.

On the other side of the equation are Bitcoin’s devoted enthusiasts who saw in its technology a promising way to change the global financial system.

“This is the first time that there’s a real separation — just like church and state — you have a separation of money and state,” said Alex Mashinsky, founder of Celsius Network, a crypto lending platform. “That’s the innovation, that’s the excitement.”

But Bitcoin was slow to take off, notching its first transaction two years after its creation, when someone used it to buy pizza. Since then, the first-born token’s price has catapulted, doubling many times over, and hundreds of imitators have cropped up — some with more success than others.

Many of those who got in early stayed faithful, watching as it made its way through a boom and bust cycle unrivaled by almost anything else over the last decade.

At the beginning of 2017, Bitcoin jumped above $1,000. By mid-summer, it had more than doubled. Insanity was unleashed. By year-end, it hovered above $14,000. But as swiftly as it ran up, it fell even faster. By the end of 2018, Bitcoin barely budged above $3,000. Yet shortly after its crash, it embarked on another huge rally, this time reaching as high as $13,800 in the summer of 2019.

“Certainly the numbers are what appeals to investors,” said David Tawil, president of ProChain Capital. “The next 10 years need to be a totally different stage of growth based on totally different factors than the first stage.”

As much as it’s made a fortune for speculators and some thieves, Bitcoin’s survival will rest on further adoption. It’s not being used as a widespread medium of exchange. A few large retailers are accepting payment in Bitcoin but there hasn’t been the large-scale embrace so many had predicted. Scams are still running rampant. Interest is waning and consolidation among large owners is at a higher level than it was during the height of the 2017 bubble, which means that their influence over prices could be increasing.

Projections for the next decade abound. In the 2020s, mass adoption is surely to take off, they say. Blockchain technology will revolutionize and solve every problem in the world. On the other hand, regulatory scrutiny is likely to intensify, with central bankers paying closer attention than ever before.

In the more immediate term, some speculators forecast 2020 might be less fraught with volatility given its upcoming halving, whereby the number of coins awarded to so-called miners who process transactions is cut by 50%. That’s set to happen in May 2020 (the internet is replete with countdown clocks). The coin’s previous cut, about four years ago, coincided with a run-up in its price, pushing many crypto evangelist to believe in a repeat.

To CoinList’s Andy Bromberg, the halving is already priced in. “Maybe it’s been overpriced in and everyone’s bought into this thesis and we see a dip post-halving,” said the firm’s co-founder and president in an interview. “That would not shock me.”

But beyond next year, “Bitcoin is finding its own narrative as digital gold,” he said. “It feels like that narrative is picking up steam and it’s breaking away on its own. I would define success for most crypto assets as doing exactly that.”","(Bloomberg) -- Want the lowdown on what's moving Asia’s markets in your inbox every morning? Sign up here.

Thousands of tourists have been told to flee as Australia’s wildfires look set to worsen, Kim Jong Un has once again lived up to his unpredictable reputation, and investors are marveling over Bitcoin’s bull run last decade. Here are some of the things people in the markets are talking about today.

Get Out

Thousands of tourists holidaying on the south coast of Australia’s New South Wales state have been told to evacuate before the weekend when extreme weather is set to intensify deadly wildfires sweeping through the region. In an unprecedented appeal, the Rural Fire Service said anyone in the southeastern tip of the state should get out in the next two days. The 230-kilometer (143-mile) stretch from Batemans Bay down to the Victoria state border has been ravaged by fires this week, producing apocalyptic scenes as infernos turned the sky blood red and rained down embers and ash on communities. At least seven people have been killed on the south coast of New South Wales just this week and hundreds of properties destroyed. Right now, isolated communities in Victoria remain cut off by road, including the township of Mallacoota, where some 4,000 people were forced to shelter on the beach or escape by boat as wildfires swept through. Military helicopters and ships have been scrambled to bring in supplies and for potential evacuations if roads can’t be re-opened.

“Pay for the Pains”

Kim Jong Un declared he was no longer bound by his pledge to halt major missile tests and would soon debut a “new strategic weapon,” adding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s foreign policy concerns in a politically charged election year. The North Korean leader told a gathering of party officials in Pyongyang that U.S. actions left him no choice but to reconsider commitments that underpinned three unprecedented meetings with Trump over the past 18 months, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday. Kim called for “shocking actual action” to make the U.S. “pay for the pains” suffered by North Korea under the Washington-led sanctions regime, KCNA said. The speech came during an unusual four-day party meeting and appeared to replace the televised address Kim has delivered every New Year’s Day since 2013. Kim is seeking sanctions relief and security guarantees that the Trump administration has so far refused to provide without a disarmament commitment from Pyongyang.

Markets Wait

Traders eyed a cautious start on Thursday in Asia as they assessed the latest policy move by China’s central bank and awaited data on the country’s manufacturing sector. Australia’s dollar and the yen edged lower. Activity is set to pick up as most global markets reopen from holiday closures on Jan. 1, though Japanese equities remain shut for the remainder of this week. The People’s Bank of China on Wednesday said it will increase the supply of cheap funding to banks, a move of policy support in line with market expectations. Markets start this year on the back of a strong performance for global stocks and sovereign bonds in 2019. Thursday gives investors the latest read on Chinese manufacturing with the Caixin manufacturing PMI expected to hover around its November level — remaining well in the expansionary zone. Elsewhere, crude fell 1% to $61.06 a barrel on Dec. 31, and gold was at $1,517.29 an ounce.

Mr Hannafin was remanded on continuing bail as a result to the next sittings of Longford Circuit Criminal Court on January 14 2020.","Dear Moneyist,

My mother passed away last year. I share the title of my mother’s home with my stepfather, but he wants to get married again and wants his new wife to move into the house. What happens when he dies? Does she have any right to the house or can I kick her out immediately after he dies?

Vanessa

Dear Vanessa,

Given that he’s about to have another chance at love and in the holiday spirit and interest of decorum, let’s start by wishing them the best in their new lives together and hope they both live long and happy lives. It’s nice that he doesn’t have to be alone anymore and is able to share the remainder of his life with a woman he loves.

Also see:As a baby boomer, I didn’t grow up with this culture of entitlement — do I have to leave my estate to my children or spouse?

If you and your stepfather’s names are listed on the title deeds of your mother’s former home, he owns 50%. His new wife would be his legal heir and, for better or for worse, you would end up owning the house with this woman. If he is a tenant for life, then the 50% of your mother’s former home would pass to you when he dies, assuming you are an only child.

Recommended: ‘What did he do with all the money?’ My dying husband cashed his $700K life insurance and emptied his bank accounts

In the meantime, I would like to gently suggest welcoming your stepfather’s new wife into your lives as a member of your extended family. Try, if you can, to put this territorial approach to one side for now. You don’t know this woman. What if she is warm and caring and wants for nothing except the love and support of her husband and his family?

At the very least, it will help the years pass without rancor and bitterness. If he invites you to the wedding, raise a glass to their health and happiness. Who knows, they may enrich your life in ways you could not have imagined and that go beyond the half share of your mother’s property. You may even find yourself wishing that they both stick around for a very long time.

34,34,AG pledges action to arrest crime,Ray Sefo's bucket list for 2020 includes signing more big name fighters,"Some initiatives will be introduced within the Royal Barbados Police Force (RBPF) throughout 2020 as authorities make moves to keep crime under control, speed up some processes and spread thin resources.

This assurance has come from Attorney General Dale Marshall, who promised to “redouble” his efforts to tackle the crime situation and achieve greater efficiency within the crime fighting agency.

“The Royal Barbados Police Force will also be redoubling its efforts,” Marshall told Barbados TODAY, adding that for him, 2020 will be about “action and achieving results”

The length of time it takes to get a police certificate of character has been a major concern. Marshall said he would be meeting with Commissioner of Police Tyrone Griffith on Tuesday to thrash out those and other issues affecting the RBPF.

Pointing out that there has been a deficit in the Force for over two decades, Marshall said they would also be finding ways to make the profession more attractive and to better mobilize resources to bring about solutions.

“But until that happens, and we can recruit the additional numbers that we need, we have to do things differently,” he said.

“So, for example, the police certificate of character takes up to six police officers. We are completely automating that. Over the next five to six weeks you will see a whole new computer-driven mechanism for getting police certificates of character, which will see them coming out in a matter of days and actually being emailed back to you. We have developed an application so you can actually make the application on your mobile phone,” he explained.

The Attorney General also said that come next year, police officers would also stop responding to minor accidents.

“Those matters are really matters best left to insurance companies because at the end of the day it is really about who is going to pay. Those are not the kinds of things people get charge for,” he said.

“So police will continue to go to fatal accidents and serious accidents, but the run of the mill accidents – somebody bounced your car in a carpark and you are not moving until the police comes – that takes up valuable policing time,” said Marshall.

This, he suggested, would allow officers to tackle more serious issues.

“So, when it comes to us being able to strategically and holistically reduce all levels of crime and, especially in relation to murders, how we deploy our manpower is going to be key and we are going to be rolling out a whole set of initiatives to take care of that,” he said.

With mere hours to go before 2019 comes to a close, there have been a record 49 murders in Barbados.

Despite the “unprecedented” number of killings, most of which were executed through gunplay, Marshall told Barbados TODAY he was satisfied enough was being done to bring the situation under control.

“Of course there has been enough action this year. The members of the police force have worked more than assiduously in terms of investigations,” he said.

The trained attorney explained that “a lot of things that don’t make the Press” were happening, including several successful intelligence-driven operations leading to the seizure of illegal weapons and the stemming of firearm importation.

“We know, though, that there has been an accumulation of firearms on our streets over the last decade. Our mission is to ferret those out and to ferret out those individuals who have been using them. So there are things that have been going on that have been achieving results for us,” insisted Marshall.

“I know as the year ends everyone is concerned about the high level of murder rates. Forty-nine murders in any year is unprecedented for Barbados, but I want Barbadians to stay the course.

“We have put, in difficult financial times, extraordinary financial resources for the police. We are gradually changing how the police do things so as to free up manpower to deal with the more serious things,” assured Marshall.

[email protected]","NEW YORK – PFL president Ray Sefo is looking to build on his roster.

The 2019 PFL Championship took place at the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday, marking one of the biggest shows in the promotion’s short history. Once again, six fighters walked away with world titles and $1 million.

And having recently signed former Bellator welterweight champion Rory MacDonald, Sefo said the goal is to continue to sign some marquee names in the sport.

“(I want to) sign more big name fighters (and) continue to grow,” Sefo said at the post-fight news conference. “But my phone was going off like crazy throughout the show because everybody got to see the PFL show tonight and got to see all the champions get crowned.

“It just goes to show that we’re continuing to grow. And then adding someone like Rory to the mix, the sky’s the limit for PFL – and there’s a lot of discussions with other people that are interested and want to come over.”

Also on the agenda moving forward is the possibility of superfights. Featherweight champ Lance Palmer and lightweight champ Natan Schulte were two names that were brought up as suggestions for a potential superfight, and while only Palmer seemed quite keen, Sefo likes the idea in general.

“There’s a lot in the works for PFL, and those were part of discussions along the way,” Sefo said. “Not necessarily Natan and Lance, but we talked about doing some superfights and whatnot. But that’s part of the plan. Whether it happens next year or the year after that, I’m not sure exactly. But there are discussions in terms of putting on some superfights.”

The ESPN deal was arguably the biggest development for the promotion this year, giving the fighters the largest platform possible, to showcase their skills.

“ESPN has been great,” Sefo said. “I mean, they’ve been a great partner and the fact we’re on ESPN speaks volumes. It just goes to show that – and it sends a message out there – that PFL is here and that we’re alive and well and we’re going to continue to sign some big names and continue to grow.”",4.0,4.0,2.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,4.0,1.6666666666666667,2.0," Attorney General Dale Marshall promises to “redouble’s efforts to tackle crime situation and achieve greater efficiency within the Royal Barbados Police Force .

Imagine having to get all of your groceries from a gas station or local corner store bodega where you're forced to select bags of chips and frozen pizza as sustenance. This is the reality for the millions of citizens who live in food deserts in the United States. The United States lacks equal access to food across communities and food availability is scarce in portions of the country known as food deserts.

In 2014, the United States Department of Agriculture performed a food access study and defined a US food desert as an area where 33 percent of a city’s residents live more than one mile from a supermarket and 20 percent earn below the poverty line. Many residents of food desert locations do not have cars and lack access to public transportation, making them essentially unable to get to a grocery store. Food desert causes are mostly related to economics. Big chain supermarkets have a hard time turning a profit in impoverished areas, which results in places without food cropping up across the country. The effects are devastating. The obesity rates in these areas are generally higher, meaning life-threatening illnesses like diabetes and heart disease are on the rise. Luckily, new laws and various grassroots organizations are currently working to make healthy, affordable food available nationwide. On a local level, many cities have not just opened up food co-ops and food markets in impoverished areas. Local corner stores are also expanding their inventory. Instead of using all of their shelf space for junk food, they are providing more healthy fresh food options.

According to Korean Entertainment News platform Soompi, the report was confirmed by the news outlet, Market News which published a report at midnight KST on January 2 stating that according to their investigation, they were exclusively reporting that Momo and Heechul are dating.

Market News is the outlet that reported in August that Momo and Heechul were in a relationship, and in the January 2 report they mentioned that Super Junior's Label and JYP Entertainment had denied that they are dating at the time.

Kim Heechul and Momo have been seen together on several shows, like Weekly Idol which featured Heechul as a temporary host and Momo as part of her girlgroup, Twice several times. Momo has also been on Knowing Bros, with him. Most of the times on these shows, Heechul has been really impressed by Momo, who hails from Japan and is a dancer. One of the video clips which went viral at the time of an episode of Weekly Idol airing was a clip where Momo re-enacts a Japanese character saying 'Nicco nicco ni,' to do aego, a cute display of affection often expressed including but not limited to through a cute/baby voice, facial expressions, and gestures.

As news of them confirmed to be dating broke, fans couldn't be happier, being super supportive despite of some pointing out that Kim Heechul and Momo have an age difference of 13 years. 'Momo' became a Twitter trend worldwide as fans woke up to the news.

37,37,Pope Francis apologises after slapping woman's hand,WATCH: Pope Francis Slaps Woman's Hand on New Year's Eve,"Pope Francis has apologised after slapping a woman’s hand as he greeted pilgrims at the Vatican on New Year’s Eve.

‌Francis lost his cool when the woman abruptly grabbed his hand and yanked him towards her just after he reached out to greet a child during a visit to the Vatican’s nativity scene on Tuesday night.

The woman would not let go of him and in a gesture that appeared to cause him pain, he slapped at her hand before pulling his hand free.

During his Angelus address to a packed St Peter’s Square on New Year’s Day, the pontiff referred to his actions. “I apologise for the bad example yesterday … sometimes even I lose patience”, he said.

The identity of the woman is unknown, but a video of the incident went viral, sparking indignation on social media. One Twitter user wrote: “What the pope did demonstrates one thing – he’s a man.”

In his address on Wednesday morning, the pope also condemned violence against women. He said: “By how we treat a woman’s body, we can understand our level of humanity.”

In another clip that went viral earlier this year, Pope Francis repeatedly yanked his hand away from being kissed by a long queue of people. The waiting pilgrims had been attempting to kiss his papal ring as part of a tradition, practised by more conservative Catholics, to show respect to the pontiff.

A few days after the incident, the Vatican said Francis had been worried about spreading germs. However, experts said at the time that his reluctance to have his papal ring kissed reflected an uneasiness with an element of traditional protocol that had lost its original meaning.","Pope Francis found himself at the center of controversy on New Years Eve after he slapped a woman’s hand for grabbing him and not letting go.

After telling her to let go, Pope Francis slapped her hand twice as a guard then held the woman back.

The incident split online Catholics and other social media users, who debated whether the Pope responded in an appropriate manner.

The two countries exchanged the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations between India and Pakistan, the External Affairs Ministry said. This was done simultaneously through diplomatic channels in New Delhi and Islamabad.

The exchange of the list came amid tense diplomatic ties between the two countries over the Kashmir issue.

The agreement was signed December 31, 1988 and came into force January 27, 1991.

The pact mandates the two countries to inform each other of nuclear installations and facilities to be covered under the agreement on the first of January of every calendar year.

39,39,Quebec Proved to Be Attractive Enough for Lotto Windfalls,Here are the Lotto and Lotto Plus results,"0 SHARES Share Tweet

Quebec lottery fans have celebrated quite the cash windfalls over the past twelve months, with bigger and better lotto jackpots making their way to their pockets. Lotto 6/49 was once again among the preferred tickets purchased by many Canadians, but it seemed like many of the cash prizes were eventually drawn to the eastern regions of the country.

Today we are going to review some of the heftiest Lotto 6/49 jackpots bagged by Quebec players this year. Purchasing tickets as a group has made the entire gaming experience more special for Canadians, as it makes them feel part of a community that could soon become much richer. This is also true for tickets purchased by couples that have agreed to split the jackpot and invest it in something both individuals would find enjoyable.

Lotto 6/49 Proves Generosity

Such was the case with a couple hailing from Gatineau that became eligible for a cash windfall of CA$7 million mid-July. Just like many winners before them, the two Lotto 6/49 enthusiasts were in a state of disbelief upon realizing their lives would never be the same again. Colette Laberge and Mario Lafrenière collected their jackpot and took a photo with the hefty cheque at Casino du Lac-Leamy.

The winging draw for the two of them took place on July 10, highlighting the numbers 07, 15, 22, 28, 43, 49, plus the bonus one 45. Matching the six main numbers sufficed, making their ticket a lucky one indeed. Winners revealed that they had purchased the winning ticket at Uniprix Danyel Dessureault, Place de la Cité-des-Jeunes.

According to Loto-Quebec’s regulation, every retail point associated with a winning purchase is eligible for a 1-percent slice of the jackpot. This granted the location some CA$70,000, a motivation for many retailers to include lottery offerings in their array of offerings. One of the regular questions, when winners collect their prize, is related to their plans. The Gatineau couple had already come up with a plan that included treating their extended family as well.

Larger Prizes Claimed

Another permanent resident of Quebec would forever remember this year as a special one thanks to his lucky Lotto 6/49 ticket purchase. The first days of August were special for Daniel Lavoie of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean who was the proud winner of CA$3.5 million jackpot. This was half of the August 7 Lotto 6/49 Main prize, but still a generous cash pile for the Canadian.

August 7 brought a Lotto 6/49 draw coming with a CA$7-million prize that was eventually split between the two tickets eligible for it. The numbers drawn at that draw were 05, 08, 09, 19, 28, 31, plus the bonus one 18. Mr. Lavoie purchased his ticket at the Couche-Tard convenience store in Chambord ahead of the lucky draw.

Just like every other retail location selling winging tickets, the convenience store received one percent of the payout. In this case this amounted to CA$35,000 piece of the Main prize. The lotto millionaire was certain that he would continue working at least for the time being, despite the windfall. He also began looking for the perfect new home for his family.","Here are the winning Lotto and Lotto Plus numbers from the Wednesday, January 1 draw:

40,40,North Korea's Warning to America: End Your 'Hostile Policy' Or Get Nothing,Here’s North Korea’s New Year’s gift to the world,"In the most anticipated speech of his career today, North Korea’s Kim Jong-un told hundreds of cadre from the Workers’ Party of Korea to prepare for a long-term standoff with the United States over its drive to “seek its own political and diplomatic interests” in Korea while “wasting time away under the signboard of dialogue and negotiations.”

But to the obvious surprise of many U.S. experts, Kim hedged on making any move that would cross a red line for the Trump administration or the Pentagon. Instead, he left the door open for further negotiations over peace and denuclearization – but only if the United States “rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK” and helps build “a lasting and durable peace-keeping mechanism” on the peninsula.

In some ways, Kim’s remarks restated the regime’s long-standing policy on talking to Washington, with an extra dose of determination to withstand the withering U.S. and UN sanctions that have crippled Kim’s attempts to remake North Korea’s economy and stifled any moves towards inter-Korean reconciliation over the last two years. “The DPRK-U.S. stand-off which has lasted century after century has now been compressed to clear stand-off between self-reliance and sanctions,” he said.

If that situation continues, Kim declared, the “long confrontation” with the U.S. might include the introduction “in the near future” of a “new strategic weapon” that he declined to describe (apart from being capable of “shocking actual action.”) Moreover, he would show his new hand by ending the halt he declared in 2018 to further development of nuclear weapons and the “test-fire” of long-range ICBMs capable of hitting the United States. “There is no ground for us to get unilaterally bound to that commitment any longer,” he said.

To make the case for ending the moratorium, Kim pointed to the “big and small” military drills carried out by the U.S. military in and around Korea since the talks began in 2018, and its introduction of “ultra-modern warfare equipment” from the United States into South Korea. As he spoke, a fleet of U.S. spy planes, based primarily in nearby Okinawa and carrying the most sophisticated surveillance equipment in the world, combed Korean skies looking for any signs of new tests that would violate the moratorium.

Read the original article.","We didn’t wind up getting that Christmas present from Kim Jong-un that he promised. (Not even the vase that President Trump suggested.) While most of us were expecting either a weapon’s test or a missile launch, all remained quiet in the hermit nation for the remainder of the year. But this morning the dictator released a statement through his country’s state-run media outlets that appears to explain what the real “present” was going to be. As of today, North Korea is no longer considering itself bound to the weapons testing moratorium agreed to between Kim and Trump. (NY Times)

North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, ​said his country no longer felt bound by its self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, its official media reported on Wednesday, the strongest indication yet that the country could soon resume such tests… North Korea has not conducted a long-range missile test or a nuclear test in more than two years. Mr. Kim had announced his moratorium at a time when he hoped negotiations with the United States — and his budding personal relationship with President Trump — would prompt the United States to begin lifting crippling sanctions.

Kim was still being rather vague about what he plans to do, but he promised that the world would soon see a “new strategic weapon” being deployed from the Korean Peninsula. (The Hill)

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned the world will witness “a new strategic weapon” from the isolated nation in the “near future” as nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang are stuck in a stalemate. According to reports of his remarks from North Korean state media, Kim blasted the U.S. for its “hostile policy” toward North Korea and said he had no expectation Washington would lift sanctions on his country soon.

Reached for comment at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump appeared to discount the threat, saying that he still believes Kim Jong-un is “a man of his word” and will find a way to close the deal. Of course, that’s pretty much been Trump’s modus operandi throughout this entire process. Keep flattering Kim while refusing to give in to his demands. And Trump will no doubt continue to play nice until it’s time get tough.

As long as North Korea is only talking about violating the agreement and not actually doing it, there’s still time to cut a deal. It’s even conceivable that Trump could put some small concession on the table along the lines of a partial withdrawal of one or two minor sanctions. That would at least give Kim something to take home and claim a victory if he’s willing to at least continue the moratorium, if not actually start dismantling his nukes.

But in reality, those nukes are the only thing keeping Kim in power, at least in his view. It’s almost impossible to conceive of him really carrying through on a comprehensive denuclearization program.

So if he doesn’t, what might the “new strategic weapon” be? Intelligence analysts seem to think it will be one of two things. Either he’ll light off a fully functional hydrogen bomb or he’ll test an ICBM with solid fuel propellant that can definitely make it all the way across the Pacific to the west coast of the United States. Either one would be provocative in the extreme and send us right back to where we were stuck before Trump reached out to him.

2020 may be starting off on an upward path domestically but in terms of our negotiations with North Korea, we’re already hitting a sour note. And with Russia and China courting Kim’s favor these days, I’m not particularly hopeful of the situation improving any time soon.",1.3333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,1.0,1.3333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,2.0,1.6666666666666667," North Korea’s Kim Jong-un told hundreds of cadre from the Workers’ Party of Korea to prepare for a long-term standoff with the United States .

41,41,"10 years after surgery, Ryan Westmoreland lands coaching job at UMass-Dartmouth",Two-time Semi Finalist Vera Zvonareva to Miss Australian Open,"This coming March, it will have been 10 years since Ryan Westmoreland experienced the scariest day of his life. He was on an operating table at St. Joseph’s Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix as Dr. Robert Spetzler prepped for a five-hour procedure to remove a cavernous malformation on his brain stem.

At the time, Westmoreland was the No. 1 prospect in the Boston Red Sox organization and the 21st-ranked minor league player in all of baseball. But as doctors started to put the former Portsmouth High School star under anesthesia, his thoughts didn’t drift toward a future career in the bigs and he wasn’t dwelling on when he’d get back on the field.

He was praying he’d make it through alive.

Nearly a decade has passed since March 16, 2010 — the date of that surgery, which is emblazoned on his arm with a tattoo — and on the anniversary, Westmoreland will be back on the field as an assistant coach on Bob Prince’s staff at UMass Dartmouth.

“It was perfect. I had lost two of my assistant coaches to head coaching jobs, and I had been passively looking [to replace them],” Prince said. “The timing couldn’t have been any better. I reached out to Ryan and it went from there. We had a nice conversation in regards to the program and his role, his expectations.”

Westmoreland is currently working with teenage players with the Ocean State Makos, an AAU team. And, in a way, that’s how he ended up with the Corsairs. He was touting some of his players to Rian McCarthy, an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator with UMass Dartmouth. McCarthy, who had previously coached the Post 18 American Legion team in Newport, asked Westmoreland if he had considered coaching at the next level.

“I said absolutely,” Westmoreland said. “I wasn’t reaching out for jobs, but he asked me if I’d be interested, I talked with Coach Prince and it snowballed from there. I’m excited.”

When Westmoreland’s professional baseball career ended in 2013, he never envisioned himself as a coach. But after starting with the Portsmouth High School freshman team in 2015, then working with the Makos, he realized he could impart his vast knowledge of the game on the next generation of future stars.

And he found it quite enjoyable.

“When I retired, I wasn’t dead set on being a coach,” Westmoreland said. “The first year I coached, I said to myself, ‘I have a lot of knowledge and things I can teach.’ Not only the physical, but also the mental part of the game. I can teach what I’ve learned and then watch them to grow up and be successful.”

Westmoreland was a star at Portsmouth High School, twice named the state’s Gatorade Player of the Year, before graduating in 2008. That year, he was chosen by the Red Sox in the fifth round of the MLB First-Year Player draft. A five-tool player with tremendous potential, Westmoreland by the end of his second professional season was named the club’s top prospect.

But early in 2010, he felt tingling in his fingers and realized something wasn’t right. Westmoreland had a cavernous malformation on his brain stem that required a dangerous surgical procedure. He attempted a comeback and was invited to Red Sox spring training in 2011, but a second surgery forced him to give up the game he loves so much at just 22 years old.

There were some dark times, but Westmoreland found solace in coaching. Now he’ll take the next step in what he hopes is a lifelong endeavor. With UMass Dartmouth, Westmoreland said he won’t have a defined role, but is willing to do what is asked of him.

″[Coach Prince] just said, ‘We want you to be part of our program,’ And that was huge for me, because I’ve never coached in college,” Westmoreland said. “It looks like whatever I can do to help the team, and whatever Coach Prince wants me to do, I’m happy to do it.”

Prince knows what he’s getting in Westmoreland.

“He brings a lot,” Prince said. “Just the experience in terms of playing and the process and the grind that these kids go through. And he’s been working with kids who are at a high level. He’s been successful at developing players, and that’s what we’re about — developing players and people.”

Prince said Westmoreland isn’t hesitant to talk about what happened 10 years ago, and that most of the players already know his story. Infielder JR DiSarcina is the son of Gary DiSarcina, who was the manager of the Lowell Spinners when Westmoreland was with the club in 2009.

“When [the players] caught wind of what was going on, we were all on a group text, and one of the players said, ‘Oh my God, I have his rookie card and he autographed it for me.’ The kids know who he is,” Prince said.

For Westmoreland, this coaching position could be a stepping stone.

“I really hope it opens that door,” Westmoreland said. “Ever since I started coaching, I knew I wanted a future in this. I was looking to get into the college baseball world, and we’ll see where it goes from there. But this is a great opportunity.”

And he has a backer in Prince.

“He wants to be involved in baseball at a high level, whether it’s coaching in college, professionally or scouting,” Prince said. “My job, as it is with my players, is to help him get him to where he wants to go.”","Former World No. 2 Vera Zvonareva will miss the Australian Open - the first Grand Slam of the 2020 season - due to problems with her left wrist.

Updated

Victorian authorities are ramping up efforts to reach and evacuate cut-off communities in East Gippsland, where 28 people remain missing after destructive bushfires tore through the region.

Key points: Remote communities across the region are either evacuating in convoys or preparing to stay and defend

In one isolated town, several residents are relying on a single shared radio at the general store

For the latest information, visit the Vic Emergency website

Premier Daniel Andrews said 24 Victorian communities were still isolated by bushfires on Thursday afternoon.

Rescue crews were battling to clear roads to reach them so they could evacuate before the risk increased this weekend, he said.

Nine satellite phones had also been dropped into other isolated communities.

This morning, Mr Andrews said the number of people missing in bushfire-affected areas in Victoria had risen from 17 to 28.

""I can confirm today that as at 9:30am, there are 28 people that we cannot locate, and we are very concerned about their wellbeing,"" Mr Andrews told a press conference in Melbourne.

Earlier, a body found in a home at Buchan was identified as 67-year-old Mick Roberts.

Thirty-nine firefighters from North America landed in Melbourne on Thursday afternoon to join the battle to control the East Gippsland blazes.

The charity group Need for Feed has also organised fodder to be dropped across East Gippsland to help isolated farmers trying to stop their livestock from starving.

On Friday morning some of the 4,000 people trapped in the coastal town of Mallacoota were transported to a Navy ship that arrived in the area the previous day.

They will be evacuated from Mallacoota to Western Port, at Hastings on the Mornington Peninsula, a journey that is expected to take 17 hours.

Dirt-road convoy gets out of Cann River

A convoy of 46 cars and a bus left Cann River on Thursday afternoon after residents were told trying to leave on Saturday would be extremely dangerous.

The convoy, which included emergency vehicles, was able to leave after crews cleared an old dirt track out of town.

Alison Rainey, who owns a local cafe, said they were all headed to the town of Orbost.

She said some residents who were undecided about leaving had opted to join the convoy after they were told at a briefing that Saturday would be an extremely dangerous day for the town.

Ms Rainey — who has decided to stay in Cann River — said her 10-year-old son was with his father in Bonnie Doon.

""Now that the town population has plummeted there's plenty [of food] to go around,"" she told ABC Statewide Drive.

She said she planned to take shelter in the school if things worsened.

""I feel confident that the school will be fine, that we will be protected here, I have no doubt about that.""

Nowa Nowa residents share single radio

Further west, several residents in Nowa Nowa have been relying on a single shared radio at a general store to monitor bushfire warnings.

Nowa Nowa General Store owner Sandra Huggins said the town was confronted by a ""massive wall of fire"" on Tuesday. She is now concerned about what will happen this weekend.

""Our community hasn't had power since Monday evening,"" she said.

""Because we have no power or phones or internet we're not getting any of the emergency warnings.

""If we got out of town a few Ks, we all of sudden get 'ping, ping, pings' and all these messages.

""It's a bit disconcerting to learn you're on Watch and Act, which you didn't even know.""

A passing tradie left them with a decent radio, which is now located in the only part of town with reception — in the car park outside the store.

""We don't get radio reception in our store or in our house,"" Ms Huggins said.

""That's our only contact with what's happening, we have no idea otherwise.

""It's very scary, especially with what happened on Monday night and what may happen.""

In the meantime, the community is cooking up the food from their defrosting freezers at a barbecue outside the shop.

""We're happy to feed anyone who wants to come and eat it,"" Ms Huggins said.

Those left in Genoa will face the fires alone

Just north-west of Mallacoota, the small community of Genoa has found itself completely cut off from Victorian authorities as a result of the fires.

CFA chief officer Steve Warrington said Victorian firefighters had asked their NSW counterparts to help, but even they could not reach the town.

He said a police officer had driven from Eden through the fire to get into Genoa and help the community as it was hit by the same blaze that devastated Mallacoota.

On Wednesday, authorities said about 100 people were trapped in Genoa.

David Sykes, who runs the nearby Wallagaraugh River Retreat, said he told his 56 guests to leave the holiday park on Sunday.

He said properties in the area had been destroyed, but most residents had already fled over the border to Eden.

""That is very, very sad, because as much as the fire out in the open has died down and is under control and in private land, you know, now the sad stories are starting to come out,"" he said.

Orbost serving as a point of refuge

The town of Orbost, which sits between Bairnsdale and Mallacoota, is serving as the main point of refuge for people leaving some of East Gippsland's more remote communities.

But some people remain trapped in remote communities to the north, such as Goongerah and Bonang.

Further west, a major relief centre at the Bairnsdale saleyards has been filling up with bushfire evacuees and about 250 horses.

East Gippsland Mayor John White said a backup centre may be needed at the local racecourse.

Metung told 'we need to evacuate'

Victorian authorities have told communities to the south and south-east of the Bairnsdale complex of fires that they are under threat and should leave as soon as possible before this weekend's weather hits.

That message was hardened by Metung CFA Captain Trevor Blundell on Thursday, who told a local meeting that the town needed to be evacuated.

""We are not safe in Metung. We are not safe in Metung. We need to evacuate this town,"" he told a crowd through a speaker on one of the brigade's trucks.

""Holidaymakers, residents, all these people in front of me looking at me, we need to leave Metung.""

First posted","There are grave fears for 17 people missing in Victoria's massive, deadly East Gippsland bushfires.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Thursday none of the 17 people missing in the region are emergency services personnel.

The increased number comes after family members confirmed Buchan man Mick Roberts had died at his home.

""There are at least 17 people that at this stage we cannot account for. Their whereabouts are unknown to us, plus there is one person confirmed as deceased,"" Andrews told reporters at Bairnsdale.

""Whilst Victoria Police have not been through the official identification processes, it is clear that the Roberts family have identified Mr Roberts and we send our condolences to their family and the Buchan community to whom he was so well-known and very highly regarded.""

About 24 communities are isolated and reaching them to deliver supplies have been difficult.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the federal government was offering any assistance requested.

Firefighters are being helped on Thursday by moderate conditions, with temperatures in East Gippsland in the low to mid 20s expected to be paired with fairly light winds of up to 20 kmh.

Today, a fleet of ships and helicopters is making its way to coastal regions to supply and rescue residents trapped by fires in an Australian Defence Force deployment to bring food, water and medical help to towns in danger.

At 5.30am there are 110 fires burning across NSW with over 50 yet to be contained.

About 50,000 homes are without power, phone networks are down, major supermarkets are closed and there are reports of people are queuing up to three hours to get food.

Fuel is also running low. Two tankers came in late yesterday and there's a ration to allow motorists enough to fuel up and get out.

This comes as the Rural Fire Service has issued a map of highlighting an area 250km long from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border, where tourists were being asked to leave.

There's a 24-hour window today to evacuate the region before extreme fire conditions return on Saturday.

Motorists are now able to travel north on the Princes Highway from Batemans Bay. A reduced speed limit of 60km/h is in place.

Fireys say there's 'no hope' of containing blazes before Saturday. Three watch and acts on South Coast. 110 fires burning across NSW, half of them uncontained.

Seven people have died so far in these fires since Monday and 176 homes have been lost.

Residents in Australian towns ravaged by the bushfires have gone into 'panic stations' following 'apocalyptic' blazes that left 50,000 families without power and entire towns with a contaminated water supply.

Desperate locals and tourists were clearing shelves in supermarkets and filling up their fuel on Wednesday.

Weather conditions are expected to worsen by Saturday and there are currently road closures impacting traffic in and out of fire-affected communities across the New South Wales south coast and parts of Victoria.

Water supplies in both states have been contaminated in some areas, while it is simply running out all together in others.

One woman who was in the town of Tura Beach phoned the ABC and described the situation as 'panic stations'.

'A car queue of 50 waiting to get petrol and people in Woolworths clearing the shelves… apocalyptic,' she said.

Steve McKenzie, managing director of East Gippsland Water, said a 'boil water notice' had been issued in multiple towns.

He said the water could remain contaminated until late tomorrow - when it could finally be tested - and also urged residents in fire-ravished towns to use as little water as possible to reserve what they could for battling blazes.

Supermarkets are giving out bottled water for free and more supplies are en route.

Bega Valley Shire Council announced a boil water notice for Quaama, Cobargo, Bermagui, Beauty Point, Fairhaven, Wallaga Lake, Wallaga Lake Heights, Wallaga Lake Koori Village and Akolele on Wednesday.

'All water for drinking, food preparation, the cleaning of teeth and ice-making needs to be boiled before use,' a statement read.

More than 110 fires are still burning across NSW on New Years Day after conditions worsened last week. Infernos are also still ravaging Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.

At least seven people on the NSW south coast and another in Victoria died on Tuesday and Wednesday, as destructive infernos razed entire communities to the ground.

On the south coast alone, at least 176 homes were destroyed and another 50,000 left without power.

The townspeople have been told it is too late to leave - and in some cases it is even too dangerous for fire crews to enter.

As a result, residents in Ulladulla in the Shoalhaven area and nearby Narooma took the opportunity on Wednesday to stock up on essentials at the local Woolworths.

But they have been urged not to over-buy out of panic.

Amanda Findley, the Mayor of Shoalhaven City Council, reminded her townspeople the power is not predicted to be restored any time soon - meaning most homes have no access to refrigeration therefore shouldn't be looking to unnecessarily stock up on food.

She went on to say there would not be a shortage of food and asked people to buy only what they need.

Craig Scott, the store manager at the Ulladulla Woolworths, said the store was running on a recently purchased generator - but it was close to running out of fuel.

He was hoping local boat owners would share their diesel to ensure essential food and milk wouldn't spoil.

'The power's out in town, but we decided to open the store just for necessities, so people can get nappies, baby food, all that sort of stuff,' he said.

He noted about 300 people were lining up on Wednesday morning, and that most people waited about two hours to be served.

Meanwhile, a 72-year-old man is unaccounted for at Belowra, 50km north-west of Cobargo.

Commissioner Fitzsimmons said the death toll is expected to climb as well, as the RFS analyse the extent of the damage on the South Coast.

'So we know that the damage that's been occasioned right throughout the south-east corner of New South Wales is a heavy toll. And more importantly we're seeing unfortunately the tragedy of lives lost as well,' he said on Wednesday afternoon.

'As the Premier quite rightly indicated, we need to prepare ourselves for that number to climb with information coming out this afternoon.'

44,44,New Minneapolis cafe experiments with pay-what-you-can model,Amicable divorce turns sour when it comes to money and moving out: Ask Ellie,"It’s a restaurant model you don’t see every day. And during the season of giving, we turn our attention toward a unique restaurant with a philosophy just as rare that has landed in the Twin Cities.

A group of industry folks have joined forces to roll out Provision community cafe in south Minneapolis, a nonprofit with a pay-what-you-can model.

For executive director and founder Anna Wienke, along with David Smith, chefs Kenny Beck, Manny Winston and Heather Mady, it’s a way to gather local resources, reduce food waste and overcome food insecurity by offering nutritious meals that are free and/or affordable.

“We’re a space dedicated to overcoming food insecurity, isolation and hardship in our community by serving family-style meals to patrons of all social, racial and economic classes — breaking down all barriers and creating an environment where everyone is welcome and engaged,” Wienke said. “Provision is a true neighborhood restaurant, with a space by local restaurant design giant Shea Design, where menus change by the day and seating and service is family-style.”

It takes a small army to run the operation at 2940 Harriet Ave. S. In addition to monetary donations, food contributions from local businesses also helps to cover or keep costs down. Volunteers are a big part of the front-of-the-house operation. An advisory board, from business and financial services to restaurant and food vendors, provide several areas of expertise.

How it works: The cafe is on a first-come, first-served basis. Dinners are offered with seatings at 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Wednesday through Friday. Brunch is available on Saturdays, with seatings at 10 a.m. and noon. Upon arrival, grab a seat at one of the community tables in the dining room and a family-style meal will be served. The menu changes daily and updates are posted on the Provisions Facebook page.

A recent dinner spread was made up of a salad, dirty rice, potato wedges, artisan breads and dessert. While on another night, a salad, penne with red sauce, roasted broccoli and cauliflower, garlic bread and dessert was on the roster.

At the end of the meal, a give-what-you-can model means you donate whatever amount you would like to or can, with the money going toward helping keep the nonprofit operation — a food-service model based on the One World Everybody Eats (“OWEE”) community café model used by several nonprofit organizations across the country — afloat.","Q: I’m a woman, age 36, who married a man from another country five years ago. I moved there and we bought a house together.

But we both found that we just weren’t compatible. He’s very laid-back; I’m hyperactive by comparison.

Since we had no children, we agreed to part in an amicable divorce.

I decided to go home for a visit, and scout the chances for work.

By luck, I was offered a terrific job and decided to stay. But I’d only brought one small suitcase along for the trip.

When I informed my ex that I’d like him to ship the rest of my things, and finalize splitting the proceeds from our house sale, his normally easygoing manner changed completely.

He became angry, said I’d have to do my own packing and shipping which had nothing to do with him. He added that the money wasn’t easily available.

I’m shocked at his meanness. Now I have to wait for my new job to allow early “vacation time” for me to travel overseas, retrieve my own things, and deal with this now-difficult ex about money that’s rightfully mine.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

How can I manage everything in two weeks of so-called “vacation” time?

Difficult Ex

A: Start preparations now. Reach out to your contacts where you lived for five years, and ask them to refer you to a reliable shipping company. Get informed from that company as to what proof of ownership or other papers may be required.

But before addressing the money issue with your ex, try a non-combative phone conversation with him asking if there’s anything you need to know about the house proceeds.

Then, communicate with the lawyer involved in the sale, and have him/her or another lawyer inform your ex that you require your share to re-settle back home.

Have as many conversations as possible to prepare yourself to be ready to proceed when you travel to complete the move.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

Invite a local friend there to help you with the packing, especially if it’s in the presence of your ex-husband.

Q: I work in an open-concept office where my co-workers and I are respectful of each other’s sound space. Most conversations on the phone or in person are kept to reasonable decibels.

Unfortunately, we received a newcomer to our space who laughs like a hyena. I’m not exaggerating. She’ll say a name aloud, then laugh in hysterical bursts.

It’s very annoying and interferes with my concentration. What do I do/say that won’t be turned back on me as workplace harassment?

Earplugs Not Enough

A: Start with a plan of accommodation, rather than annoyance. She has an ingrained habit, you have a concentration problem.

Hers may be a nervous habit which gets exaggerated in new situation. Yours is a reaction. Neither of you are affecting or interfering with the other, on purpose.

You do have to be careful in a workplace atmosphere about how you proceed. Talk first to your supervisor who’ll likely ask a human resources representative as to the best plan (if there is an HR department).

But if left on your own, speak to this co-worker aside from others, and gently tell her that her exuberant laugh is too loud for an open-concept workplace.

Ask her to please try to tone it down. To show that you’re demonstrating goodwill, you could say that you’re willing to use earplugs when you need to concentrate more.

If she reacts badly, write a note detailing who said what, and then take it higher up.

Ellie’s tip of the day

An “amicable” divorce still requires being legally informed and aware of any financial complications.

46,46,"Harry Kazianis: North Korea's Kim has THIS goal in mind (no, he's not crazy). Here's how Trump should respond","Kim Jong Un threatens to renew testing nuclear weapons, long-range missiles","With a threat to test a “new strategic weapon” in “the near future” North Korea has, in effect, put an ICBM to President Donald Trump’s head in order to gain the two concessions it wants most: sanctions relief and some sort of security guarantee.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is now playing a dangerous game of geopolitical chicken, telegraphing to the world that he most likely will test a new long-range missile that could kill millions of Americans if it landed in a heavily populated area – but would be guaranteed to provoke a devastating U.S retaliatory attack on the North.

Trump needs to play his cards right now and base his strategy on an understanding of why North Korea continues to build and test missiles and why it refuses to abandon its nuclear weapons.

KIM JONG UN SAYS NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO TAKE 'OFFENSIVE MEASURES' TO PROTECT COUNTRY'S SECURITY

If he succeeds, the president can minimize any potential nuclear challenge coming for the communist regime and even bring Kim back to the negotiating table.

Of course, any good strategy to take on the North Korean threat must be based on facts on the ground and must be rooted in historical perspective and an understanding of what the hermit kingdom is trying to achieve and what motivates Kim’s actions.

Let’s get one thing straight. Kim is not crazy nor is he suicidal. His goal is not to start a nuclear war that will spark a massive U.S. retaliation that would destroy his country and could result in his own death. His goal is to get relief from U.S. and international economic sanctions without giving up his nukes.

All it would take is the nuclear weapons aboard just one U.S. Navy ballistic submarine – carrying an astounding 192 nuclear warheads – to wipe out North Korea in roughly 20 minutes. Its population of 25 million people would be killed – all from just one submarine lurking below the surface in the Pacific Ocean – and Kim knows that. That’s some real “fire and fury.”

The North Korean dictator – who follows his grandfather and father in leading his nation like a communist hereditary monarch – has a clearly established goal we can all relate to: survival.

Let’s get one thing straight. Kim is not crazy nor is he suicidal. His goal is not to start a nuclear war that will spark a massive U.S. retaliation that would destroy his country and could result in his own death. His goal is to get relief from U.S. and international economic sanctions without giving up his nukes.

Kim believes that his nuclear weapons are the ultimate insurance policy against an attack by the U.S., South Korea or any other nation aiming to overthrow his regime.

Kim knows that U.S. and United Nations forces attacked his country in the Korean War, and is well aware that American forces have waged long wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq in the years since. He doesn’t want any foreign forces seeking regime change in a second Korean War with either a conventional or a nuclear attack – and knows his nukes can act as a deterrent to prevent that.

North Korea has made huge sacrifices to build up its small but very dangerous arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles. Although the nation has an economy smaller than the state of Montana and can barely feed its own people, it has beaten the odds to join the nuclear club.

But because the North has spent huge sums of money and endured years of international economic sanctions to go nuclear, it’s not realistic to expect to Kim to simply hand over all his nuclear bombs and missiles to the U.S. anytime soon.

Demanding such a full denuclearization in return for eventual sanctions relief – something that would take years – is not a policy at all, but a recipe for disaster, simply ensuring that Kim builds more and bigger nuclear weapons.

A senior White House adviser told me that he considers North Korea “a fourth-world nation that could kill 100 million people in an hour – and that’s just with nukes, never mind all those chemical and biological weapons. North Korea is a Pandora’s box that – if you open it with military force – will spark at the very least a mini Armageddon.”

From all of this, a very clear strategy can emerge for the Trump administration if it can take a more long-term approach. The administration needs to understand that for at least the short to medium term, North Korea will be unwilling to give up its nuclear arms – the regime said as much just weeks ago.

For now, Team Trump must focus on starving the regime of any resources it can get its hands on to advance its nuclear program through the tightest sanctions possible and depriving the Kim family of any technology that could advance such a cause.

And that’s just the beginning. Washington must also ensure that Pyongyang does not sell any of its nuclear or missile technology. There is clear evidence that North Korea and Iran have traded such knowledge over the years.

America must do all it can to ensure that such transfers stop and that no other nation gains from North Korea’s nuclear advances – and prevent Pyongyang from making money off them to advance its weapons of mass destruction programs.

Such a policy of what amounts to a Cold War-style containment must be matched by a willingness to continue dialogue. The history of U.S.-North Korea relations is filled with too many ups and downs – tensions and breakthroughs that are too dangerous to continue.

We must be willing to try and remove the reasons that North Korea feels it needs nuclear weapons. That can only be done by building trust. As a start, a formal peace declaration ending the Korean War should be signed. In addition, liaison offices should be set up in each nation’s capital to ensure a crisis does not end up in a shooting war.

From there, both sides should work on small steps to remove all military threats facing the other – both nuclear and conventional. In fact, we should make the nuclear disarmament of North Korea the end goal of a long-term policy shift that could take years but lead to a more stable, less up-and-down relationship.

None of this will be easy. In fact, it would be much easier to do what every other U.S. administration has done on North Korea: confront the regime when it acts aggressively, punish it with sanctions and sound tough, but then move on to the next global crisis or challenge at home when missiles stop heading skyward. That would be a mistake.

Eventually, President Trump or a future president may reluctantly come to the painful conclusion that getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons is as impossible as trying to get Russia, China, India, Pakistan, or another member of the nuclear club to turn back the clock and give up its nukes.

Should that day come, our fallback position should be to press for an arms control agreement to limit the North Korean nuclear force to the smallest size possible in return for normalized relations.

Past U.S. leaders weren’t happy when the Soviet Union and China went nuclear – but weren’t prepared to start a nuclear war to force their denuclearization. And in all the years since, no nation has launched a nuclear attack.

In remarks Tuesday to party leaders– and shared on state media Wednesday– Kim also warned of introducing a “new strategic weapon” in the near future.

Kim’s audience also heard him accuse the United States of making “gangster-like demands,” according to Reuters.

At times smiling or slapping the podium, Kim charged the U.S. with maintaining a “hostile policy” that included holding continued joint military drills with South Korea, adopting cutting edge weapons and imposing sanctions,

KIM JONG UN SAYS NORTH KOREA NEEDS TO TAKE ‘OFFENSIVE MEASURES’ TO PROTECT COUNTRY’S SECURITY

“The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,” Kim said, using the initials for North Korea’s official name–the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, according to Reuters.

While saying he no longer felt bound to honor a moratorium, the rogue leader gave no clear indication that a resumption of such tests was impending. He also appeared to leave the door open for eventual negotiations with the U.S.

Kim has used the diplomatic stalemate to expand his military capabilities by intensifying tests of shorter-range weapons. His arsenal is now estimated to include 40 to 50 nuclear bombs and various delivery systems, including solid-fuel missiles designed to beat missile-defense systems and developmental ICBMs potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.

Kim has also strengthened his negotiating position, moving the diplomacy closer to an arms reduction negotiation between nuclear states rather than talks that would culminate in a unilateral surrender of the weapons he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.

HARRY KAZIANIS: NORTH KOREA’S KIM HAS THIS GOAL IN MIND (NO, HE’S NOT CRAZY). HERE’S HOW TRUMP SHOULD RESPOND

Lee Sang-min, a spokesman for South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said North Korea carrying out its threat to showcase a new strategic weapon would be unhelpful for diplomacy.

Kim’s comments published in state media Wednesday were made at a key, four-day meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee as talks between Washington and Pyongyang have faltered over disagreements on disarmament steps and the removal of sanctions.

President Donald Trump said he had a good relationship with Kim and thought the North Korean leader would keep his word, Reuters reported.

“He likes me, I like him. We get along. He’s representing his country, I’m representing my country. We have to do what we have to do.

All items used to care for the patient should be bagged as clinical waste, including the contents of the bin, and quarantined until it is known whether the patient has tested positive for WN-CoV.

Fabric curtains and screens should also be bagged as infectious linen, while any cloths or mop heads used during cleaning should be disposed of as single use items.

If the patient spent any time in communal areas, these should be cleaned with detergent and disinfectant as soon as possible.

According to the initial guidance, GPs who suspect a patient could have the virus during a consultation should leave the room immediately, leaving the patient and their belongings inside, wash their hands and conduct the remainder of the consultation by phone. They should also contact the local health protection team.

If GPs suspect a patient has the virus during a telephone consultation they should avoid a face-to-face assessment in primary care and instead call the local secondary care infection specialist.

Spread of coronavirus

So far no known cases of WN-CoV have been reported in the UK. On Friday, England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said that the risk to the UK public remains low. However he added: 'there may well be cases in the UK at some stage'.

'We have tried and tested measures in place to respond. The UK is well prepared for these types of incidents, with excellent readiness against infectious diseases,' Professor Whitty said.

Sienna Santer is a second-year Harvard student and a popular YouTube influencer with 302,000 subscribers.

She shares videos on topics like how she got into the prestigious university and what a day in her life is like.

Santer's influencer career started with friends and family members asking her how she got accepted into Harvard. After a video of her Harvard dorm-room tour got 4.8 million views, Santer treats her YouTube channel and Instagram page like a part-time job.

""I had so many people asking how I got in and if I could give them advice,"" she told Business Insider. ""Instead of writing back and forth, I decided to put everything into a video and send that to them.""

Now she earns money from ads in her videos placed by Google and by promoting brands like Audible and the vitamin company Care/of on her channel.

In 2019, she earned just over $44,000 through Google's AdSense program, which places ads in her YouTube videos, according to a screenshot viewed by Business Insider. (She said she'd have to pay about 25% of that in taxes.)

How YouTube creators like Santer earn money online

Creators with 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours are eligible for YouTube's Partner Program, through which they can earn money off their channels by placing ads in videos.

Santer averages about $3,000 a month from AdSense, she said.

""My channel has helped me deal with things a lot earlier than some of my friends and helped me a lot with money-management skills,"" she said. ""I have checks for AdSense coming in the mail that I have put aside for taxes, retirement, savings.""

How much an influencer earns from Google's AdSense program on a YouTube video depends on a number of factors, from the place in the video where viewers normally drop off to the type of advertisers the video gets. Some top creators have ad-placement strategies for earning the most money possible. Generally, how much money is earned varies based on a video's watch time, length, and viewer demographic.

Some videos that contain swearing or copyrighted music can be flagged by YouTube and demonetized, earning hardly any money for the creator (or none at all).

Santer previously told Business Insider that she usually adds two to three ads to a video that is over 10 minutes long and follows certain techniques to optimize her video's performance.

Santer is part of a rising trend of YouTubers that are gaining audiences by sharing their college experiences — especially their move-in videos, which can rack up millions of views (and in Santer's case, thousands of dollars). Margot Lee, a Syracuse student with 425,000 YouTube subscribers, teaches an informal pop-up class on becoming a professional influencer to her classmates (and shared her slides with Business Insider).

Jikh spoke to Business Insider about deciding to start a YouTube channel, how he maximizes his earnings, and how much he earned per month in 2019.

Personal finance YouTuber Andrei Jikh grew up in a family of circus performers from Russia, and he moved to the US at age 9 when his dad got a job with Cirque du Soleil.

Jikh fell in love with magic and filming home videos. Ten years later, he was hired by a startup to teach magic online.

But when his parents acquired ""crazy debt,"" Jikh became obsessed with personal finance.

""We were immigrants when we came here,"" he told Business Insider. ""We didn't really know how to manage our money, credit cards, so my parents got into crazy debt. It had a big effect on me when I was younger. At 19, I tried to teach myself, interviewing everyone I worked with to learn what they do.""

In late 2018, he quit his job, and with the roughly $200,000 he had in savings, started making personal finance videos for YouTube.

A year later, he has 300,000 subscribers and earned more than $100,000 in 2019 from ads that run in his videos — far more than the $60,000 he made at his peak year as an online magician.

""I never wanted to be in the spotlight,"" he told Business Insider. ""But if that's not your goal, then magic becomes extremely limited, and there's very few ways for you to earn money in that industry.""

Jikh's monthly revenue quickly increased

In just a few months, Jikh was starting to make real money.

Creators with 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours are eligible to have their videos monetized with ads by joining YouTube's Partner Program. How much they earn depends on a number of factors, like a video's watch time, length, video type, and viewer demographics. Some top creators have ad-placement strategies to maximize their earnings.

Here's his monthly AdSense breakdown for 2019:

January: $0. Jikh said he didn't know how to create effective thumbnails and titles.

Jikh said he spent around $10,000 to build a studio and buy camera equipment and spends five to six hours per week doing research for his videos, three to four hours filming, and 10 to 18 hours on editing. He doesn't have a talent agent or manager, he said.

Jikh said he learned to make more money by including mid-roll ads, which can run in videos lasting over 10 minutes. They can be skippable or non-skippable, and creators can place them manually or have them automatically placed by YouTube.

""You can strategically place ads wherever you want,"" he said. ""If you in the middle of talking about something important, place an ad before you say what it is. I try to place an ad every 3 to 4 minutes, just finding a natural break in the video to place it.""

He said he also earns money online through Patreon, Amazon links, affiliate marketing, and hopes to add sponsored content to the mix in 2020.

49,49,Stop using Jewish blood to smear your political enemies,New video shows men throw chair at Hasidic man in Brooklyn on Christmas Eve,"All it took for the outside world to take notice of the surge in anti-Semitic violence in the tri-state area was a man walking into a rabbi’s home with a machete. For many, the domestic terror incident that injured more than a dozen Jews in the Hasidic enclave of Monsey, New York, provided a convenient new weapon with which to strike at their political enemies.

This attack was a chameleon. It managed to represent everything and anything to the eye of the beholder. The attack, perpetrated by black men, was the fault of white supremacist fans of the president.

It was the fault of Jews for having the gall to live in blue states, for voting for Democrats.

Very sad indeed. Maybe stop voting overwhelmingly for Democrats and you might get the leadership that will protect you. Jews vote 3-1 for Dems, I don’t get it...they don’t care about you... — Covfefe2020-text Trump to 88022 (@Covfefe2020Eas) December 30, 2019

And it was Jews' faults for daring to build homes.

Goes on bla bla pic.twitter.com/6lcweVdL2R — Baruch Sandhaus (@BaruchSandhaus) December 29, 2019

The attacks happening against Jews daily (and sometimes, multiple times a day) are not a game, and yet, they are being treated as such by people more interested in scoring political points than putting an end to the violence.

Those playing these political games with Jewish lives may not be storming synagogues, supermarkets, or homes with machetes or guns, but they are still a major part of the problem leading to anti-Semitic violence and incitement.

Those who reflexively blame President Trump for any and all attacks, no matter how unrelated his administration, actions, or rhetoric are, have made a conscious choice: They would rather play politics than put an end to the violence. And worse, it seems they would like it to continue, in order to have more ammunition against the White House leading up to the 2020 election.

Just as dangerous are those on the Right who are using the occasion to lecture Jews on how they should be voting, that they should be arming themselves and fortifying their houses of worship, and where they should be living. The problem of anti-Semitism isn’t because Jews vote one way or another. (This is a complicated issue when you break down voting histories between Orthodox and secular Jews, but that is a conversation for another time.)

Solving anti-Semitism doesn’t involve making our supermarkets, schools, synagogues, and more into fortresses. That’s not how any of us want to live. Unfortunately, we’ve begun to, and yet the violence continues and is becoming more serious by the day. Most of the attacks in New York have been in the streets, and they’ve taken place against men, the elderly, and even women with their children, in broad daylight and in full view of the public.

Advocating for Jews taking advantage of the protections of the Second Amendment is a moot point for many panicked Jews living in areas where obtaining a gun permit is an uphill climb and a conceal carry permit an absolute impossibility. We can recognize that Jews are safer while armed and advocate for less restrictive gun laws while still acknowledging that guns aren’t a magic bullet to solve this crisis, either. In the long term, there is a battle to be fought for expanded access to guns, but in the short term, lectures about firearms are paternalistic and can be deeply frustrating for panicked people unable to avail themselves of the option.

That this is the case in New York and New Jersey isn’t the fault of the Orthodox Jews living there. Instead of being condescended to about needing to move, allies would be far more appreciated and be doing far more good, continuing to advocate for less restrictive gun laws in these jurisdictions instead of expecting a small community under siege to flee the homes of their parents and grandparents.

There are societal issues that are much more complex and deeper at play — the rot is far more complicated than mere politics and Trump. As long as the violence striking the Jewish community is treated as a political cudgel, it will continue unabated.

Weed dispensaries across the state opened their doors before sunrise Wednesday, welcoming long lines of customers — some who had been waiting since 4 a.m.

""Cheers to lighting up the start of 2020!"" one dispensary, Sunnyside, wrote on its Facebook page.

Under Illinois law, anyone over 21 with a valid state ID or driver's license can purchase recreational marijuana from licensed retailers.

Jackie Ryan, right, of Forest Park, Ill., becomes the first person in Illinois to purchase recreational marijuana as she purchases marijuana products from employee Brea Mooney left, at Sunnyside dispensary Wednesday, Jan. 1, 2020, in Chicago. More

Residents may legally possess up to 30 grams of cannabis flower, five grams of concentrate and 500 milligrams of THC in products such as edibles. Non-Illinois residents in the state may possess up to only half as much as residents.

The law also includes a ""social equity"" plan to improve diversity in the industry by giving a leg up to minority entrepreneurs disproportionately impacted by poverty and the war on drugs. The law expunges certain drug-based criminal records and establishes a fund to provide financial resources for business start-ups, among other provisions.

Illinois Gov. J. B. Pritzker rang in 2020 by granting more than 11,000 pardons for low-level marijuana convictions Tuesday.

""The war on cannabis has destroyed families. It has filled jails and prisons with nonviolent offenders. It has disproportionately affected black and brown communities,"" Pritzker said at a press conference on Chicago's South Side.

""Every state that has legalized cannabis has seen high demand and long lines in its earliest weeks, and to be sure, our state will, too. But unlike other states, in Illinois, we purposely built a system where the market has room to grow, so that entrepreneurs, including especially those from the communities devastated by the war on drugs, will have real opportunities in this industry.""

Illinois weed sales: Some say only white men are set to profit

Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx looks on as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker speaks during a press conference in Chicago after Foxx filed motions to vacate more than 1,000 low-level cannabis convictions, Wednesday, Dec. 11, 2019. More

Illinois is the 11th state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana. Thirty-three states allow the sale of marijuana for medical use, which Illinois legalized in 2013.

Some restrictions still apply, however. Landowners can ban cannabis use, and employers can prohibit employees from having THC in their systems.

It's illegal to drive while impaired and to possess marijuana on federal land and federally funded facilities, including some hospitals, public housing and more. Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level and cannot be taken across state lines – by any form of transportation.

The marijuana industry in Illinois could eventually bring in $1.69 billion to $2.58 billion in annual revenue, according to a study by Colorado consulting firm Freedman and Koski. That would mean an additional $440 million to $676 million in annual tax revenue statewide, the study said.

Chicago, which is facing a more than $800 million budget deficit, expects to bring in $3.5 million in revenue from marijuana taxes next year.

A long line of people brave the cold as they wait to be the first in Illinois to purchase recreational marijuana at Sunnyside dispensary Wednesday, Jan. 1, 2020, in Chicago. More

This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Cannabis in Illinois: Legal weed sales start Jan. 1","Customer Elise Swopes (R) makes a purchase at Sunnyside Cannabis Dispensary in Chicago, Illinois on January 1, 2020, the first day recreational marijuana became legal in the state

Illinois started the new year on a high note Wednesday, becoming the latest US state to legalize recreational marijuana as the governor pardoned thousands for past low-level cannabis convictions.

The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act will allow residents 21 and older to legally purchase marijuana and will expunge thousands of individuals' criminal convictions throughout the state.

""We are restoring rights to many tens of thousands of Illinoisans. We are bringing regulation and safety to a previously unsafe and illegal market. And we are creating a new industry that puts equity at its very core,"" Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said in a statement.

On Tuesday night, Pritzker granted 11,017 pardons for people with low-level cannabis convictions, the first round of a planned total of more than 700,000.

According to the statement, the new law will use 25 percent of the state's cannabis revenue to help ""the communities hit hardest"" by the earlier crackdown on marijuana.

""Today we took another step toward justice, as we continue to address the failed war on drugs and the disproportionate impact it had on communities of color,"" Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx said in the statement.

Illinois residents age 21 and older will now be allowed to legally possess 30 grams of cannabis, five grams of cannabis concentrate or 500 milligrams of THC -- the main active ingredient of cannabis -- contained in a cannabis-infused product.

Non-residents are allowed to carry 15 grams of cannabis under the bill, which will also create a licensed growing and dispensary system.

Illinois is the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana, along with Washington, DC. Thirty-four states and the federal capital permit medical cannabis treatment.

But the US Drug Enforcement Administration still considers marijuana a dangerous substance alongside LSD and heroin.

A study by the federal Centers for Disease Control published in August found that states that legalize recreational marijuana see a reduction of at least 20 percent in fatalities linked to opioid overdoses.

Marijuana legalization has also been shown to improve a state's economic activity, creating jobs and bringing in new tax revenue.",1.6666666666666667,2.0,1.3333333333333333,2.0,1.6666666666666667,1.0,1.3333333333333333," Cannabis dispensaries across the state opened their doors before sunrise Wednesday, welcoming long lines of customers .

52,53,"Expectations, Aspirations and Goals for 2020",2019 not a successful year for Nigerians – Atiku,"Ayodeji Ake, Sunday Ehigiator and Chiamaka Ozulumba, who sampled the opinion of some Nigerians, write that aside their personal goals, their expectations and aspirations for 2020 are for government to provide infrastructural development, basic amenities, as well as create better business environment for all to thrive in Year in, year out, the needs of Nigerians practically remain the same; provision of basic amenities by their elected officials, infrastructural development across board, favourable business environment and adequate security, amongst others. The incoming year is no different. As the curtain dropped on 2019 last Tuesday, to open up to 2020, the clamour across board is for security of people and properties, good governance, stable economy, vibrant health sector, viable education sector without incessant strike actions and basic amenities- good roads, stable power, adequate housing and potable water. THISDAY sampled the opinion of Nigerians across board and here are the excerpts:

Ezegbogu Malachi, Medical Doctor My expectations for Nigeria this 2020 are for a stronger and a more united country, actualisation of the dreams of our founding fathers, strong and functional government institutions, better implementation of our annual budget and a better economy. Also, I expect a stronger respect for human rights and freedom of the press. More opportunities for our teeming youth and development of indigenous talents. Mr Osanyintola Oladayo, Oil Contractor My expectations in 2020 are really high but I want to believe it’s impossible. Firstly, I will say the government must be able to provide some basic social amenities that can help improve the livelihood of all inhabitants of this country. Secondly, they must improve on job creation in various sectors of the economy. This has a long way to go in improving the economy and this would also encourage Nigerians to study because they know there is a reward for hard work. In addition, refining our crude oil here in our country will be of a better advantage and would boost the economy better, especially when the refineries function well and are properly managed. In conclusion, my expectations for Nigeria are beyond those mentioned and I know with God and good leadership, we should get positive results in no time. Mr. Adetola Adeleke; CEO Azacom Global My expectations for the year 2020 are a remarkable improvement in infrastructure, projects across the country to enhance true dividends of democracy. This is not limited to power, agriculture, education, rural development, urban renewal, power generation and transmission, prompt payment of workers salaries and allowances etcetera. Engr. Jim Oriahi, MNSE Nigeria is a great country and my expectations for 2020 are as follows: I want a Nigeria that is more focused on human development because the higher the Human Development Index (HDI), the more prosperous the country becomes. Unlike the GDP or GNP, which give income and productivity only, HDI is a vehicle for which income is turned into development; in the education or health sectors for instance. For a country to develop, the literacy level, education, and health sectors should be a priority to the government. Government must ensure that citizens have access to good health care, child mortality/mobidity rates at birth are of concerns, with access to quality education and a platform to incorporate learned knowledge to real-life situations. I look forward to a Nigeria where Income Per Capita is put in check to ensure there is a balance in labour/payments received per annum. High per capita income signifies high economic and financial security for the Nigerian populace. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is also used to determine the per capita value. Industrialisation plays a major part in a country’s development. For a country to grow, the rate of industrialisation and employment must be high, thus creating some level of job security for her citizens is very important. I want Nigeria to be such a nation with higher export than imports leading to more profits from the international trade which will ensure that there is economic growth. A Nigeria with political stability. Having stable political environment, low or no corruption, and high level of respect to the country’s laws. Good governance ensures that the level of corruption is low, transparency in the various activities of the government, and employment is based on merit. A Nigeria with good standard of living and with respect for all classes of her citizens. A Nigeria where the government and the masses uphold her peace and unity, and a country with freedom for all. God bless Nigeria. Prince Ozioma Ohia, Real Estate Contractor According to the nobel laureate Professor Chinua Achebe, ‘Nigeria’s struggles as a nation has been of leadership problems and these are manifested in policy formulation and decision making and how these policies are implemented- most of which are not people friendly and proposed policies are anathema to the polity. Some are even enacted oblivious of the electorate and the citizens. The question remains; Cui Bono? The current administration should focus on what every Nigerian yearns for. The development of the human potential. The United Nations Millennium Development Goals of vision 2020, is centered on ‘Human Capital Development’. Great emphasis and energy should be directed towards this area. Thank God for the policy of the Central Bank towards farmers, a step in the right direction. It should not be a political goal scoring point. Professor Claudius Ake asserts that ‘Mans Basic need is Food, Clothing and Shelter’. We should see more partnership between the federal government and the higher institutes of learning especially in the agro sector. There is a positive expectation from the citizenry in the coming year concerning power. The challenges of power generation should be overcome.

Vivian Oyinatumba, Student

I pray 2020 graces me with better opportunities, growth and, I hope Nigeria becomes a more conducive environment. The year 2019 did not really favour me; the year was a rollercoaster of different events rocking the country. This is why I pray for a better 2020, and that the government at all levels will do more for the masses.

Endurance Evulukwu; CEO Endykollections

My hope and expectations for the new year is to make Endykollections a fashion household name in Nigeria, and for every Nigerian woman to be an endykollectionswoman. I want to expand my business, so as to create job opportunities for the Nigerian youth. Then I want Nigeria to get better, and for every Nigerian to be passionate about contributing to nation building. And most importantly, I want to move closer to God

Timi Timz, Radio Host, PR and Comms Consultant and Entrepreneur

I know 2020 is going to be an amazing year for myself and others. It will be full of success stories, love, laughter, travels, lovely experiences and beautiful memories. Life is to be lived!

Kemi Ogunleye, Events Planner

I pray 2020 would be an amazing year for me; I strongly believe it would be filled with success for me and my friends. I also pray for anyone confused about life and their career to receive clarity in Jesus name. Stay happy always!

Henrietta Okoye; Youth Corp Member

I hope and expect to have a good job come 2020, build up my own business, travel to more than 20 countries, have a family of my own, if God permits. I pray Nigeria becomes a better country devoid of the present economic issues we’re currently battling.

Isi Stella Aigbomian, Midwife My expectations for 2020 as touching healthcare is basically an improvement on the resources in the health sector, referring to both maternal and human. In terms of material resources, I am optimistic that attention of the government and all other health related policy makers will come to the conclusion of equipping our health facilities ranging from primary health care to tertiary health facilities with necessary and basic equipment which assure quality assurance of care, both for diagnostic and patient treatment. In addition, policies that strengthen environmental sanitation and pollution control be put in place for the benefit of all. I also urge the government to prioritise healthcare of the citizens of Nigerians knowing that health is wealth. Rimamskep Ifusumu, Medical Doctor I expect a robust health institution with cancer centres in the six geopolitical regions fully equipped with modern Radioactive machines, and trauma centres built in three geopolitical regions, more funds for residency training to meet up the teaming or curb population of young doctors traveling abroad and meet up with the country’s population demand. I urge the government to increase budgetary allocation to achieve the above. Alabi Tolulope, Fashion Designer To the best of my knowledge, I believe the government needs our taxes to construct better roads in our country, and better roads will reduce the time we spend in traffic daily hence leading to greater and higher productivity on each day’s job/activities. The efficiency from jobs well done will improve the economic system. It will also divert our focus to accomplishing higher goals or trying out new inventions. People and companies evading taxes are doing the masses more harm than good, citizens who don’t pay their taxes have no right to complain about bad roads and other social amenities. So in year 2020 I implore people to pay their taxes promptly and correctly. One of the major problems with the governance of Nigeria is that the government is far from the masses. People are hungry, homeless, jobless and depressed, but the people in power seem not to know the extent to which some of their policies are affecting the masses. They should organise town-hall meetings to know what the masses are going through, this will bring governance closer to the smallest groups. Hon. Ishola Ibrahim, Politician Last year was really a roller coaster journey. After a general assessment of activities and event in 2019, it gives me great joy and expectations to look forward to 2020 as it will consolidate on achievements of 2019. I look forward to a 2020 of perfection. A year of joy creation and youths empowerment using available resources at our disposal. Investing in capacity building to make our youths discover their potentials, so as to become entrepreneurs, and in turn reduce unemployment and Al’s positive increase the country’s Gross Domestic Product. Osayuwame Ebuehi, Physiotherapist We hope that 2020 will be a good year having signed the budget early for private sector to chip in more businesses to develop the economy. And as regards the roads and electricity, with the constant and consistent payment of income tax, PAYE and VAT, and Nigerian government investing on it, Nigeria will make a better place. As regards the health, I would implore the government to provide more beds for hospitals, adequate facilities and good working Individuals. On my field, I need machines to process herbal roots and leafs to make it edible and very much reliable for consumption. Olatunji Adeleke, Professional Photographer In 2020, I expect the government to focus on building a friendly economy that attracts investors and embark on growing SME businesses as it will be a good bedrock for nation building. I also urge for the government as we approach 2020, they should stop living a lie and embark on serious and constructive poverty alleviation programmes for over 90 per cent of poverty stricken. I urge the government to be prudent in their spending, to be more calculative and wise. Adeola Alabi, Accountant I wish a good economy that will give entrepreneurs a fastanstic platform to operate, good road networks and stable electricity, as well as plan towards improving the standard of living of Nigerians by creating job opportunities for the youths. Adelaja Osisowo, Administrator, Broadcast Media Of course I expect better reform in policy making that would improve the economy in 2020. And repairs of our major roads both at the federal and state level including local levels. The government should be more proactive rather than reactive to things in 2020. Joshua Marcus Usoro, Singer and Dancer I expect a better and more stable economy and more opportunities for youths to grow and for health, I believe the Nigerian government should enforce health insurance and better equipment in hospitals for all Nigerians, it will save a lot of lives.","Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has described 2020 as symbolic in many ways, saying it’s time to work for a better future for Nigerians.

In a new year message released in Abuja on Tuesday, Atiku noted that the year heralds a brand new decade required Nigerians to stay together more than ever before.

He charged the leadership and the led to take on, head front, the common enemy of insecurity that challenged the citizenry in their everyday life.

The statement said, “I do not share the sentiments when some people claim that the outgone 2019 was a successful year for Nigerians. Such sentiments are reductionist and do the harm of making us have a false sense of victory.

“The bitter truth is that Nigeria is still in the throes of economic instability, with more people losing jobs and the attendant outcome of more children being out of school and more families having hard time in accessing basic needs of life.

“In this New Year, however, I will rather ask that Nigerians stand together with renewed vigour and determination to battle the hydra-headed demon of insecurity that has plagued us in the past decade.

“We must challenge the inadequacies that made us become the global headquarters of extreme poverty; much as we must work hard and fast enough to eliminate the scourge of out-of-school children in the country. These are the challenges that this new decade has thrown at us and we cannot afford to slumber and submit to defeat”.

Atiku observed that the problems of extreme poverty and scant investments in education played huge roles in fueling the problems of violent extremism that characterised the past decade.

He warned that the country cannot win the fight against terrorism without reducing or eliminating poverty and illiteracy.

Continuing, Atiku said, “The reality of this new decade requires of us to recalibrate our approaches and to pursue some tough choices. If failure is not an option, then we must let go of our egos and conveniences.

“In this new decade, we must start to do things differently if we are honest about our desire for a better and prosperous future. There must be a deliberate effort to improve the material wellbeing of the people, by lifting millions of Nigerians out of the extreme poverty belt at a start, and to prosperity. Government must rethink many of its policies that are sinking more people into the abyss of extreme poverty.

“It is incumbent on government at all levels to pursue policies that will provide decent housing to the mass majority; put food on the table; provide healthcare and education. We cannot continue to do things the same way and expect a different outcome. It is therefore high time we caused a rejig of economic policies that will promote an expansion of the economy and create job opportunities aplenty.

“At the individual level, this moment calls for more empathy and sacrifice. The New Year and a new decade come with the opportunity to make better impressions in our lives and in the lives of people around us.

“I wish to restate that our collective call for rule of law and our history about the struggle for democratic rule did not envisage a situation where judicial pronouncements would be worthless than the paper upon which they are rendered.

“It is a bad advertisement for the country and its democracy if declarations made by the courts are not respected without the executive arm of government agreeing to same.

“Any democracy is not worth the appellation if the principle of separation of powers is not ingrained in it. In the new year, government should not pretend to be democratic, but rather act according to the fundamentals of a democracy.

“Above all, I expect that in the New Year, there will be a better observance of rule of law and greater respect for citizens’ democratic rights.

“While we anticipate a change of attitude across board in the new year and new decade, I wish every Nigerian a happy and prosperous 2020”.",1.0,3.333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,1.6666666666666667,2.0,3.0,1.6666666666666667," The clamour across board is for security of people and properties, good governance, stable economy, vibrant health sector, viable education sector without incessant strike actions and basic amenities- good roads, stable power, adequate housing and potable water .

(AP) - An altercation in downtown Minneapolis has left one man dead and two other people with injuries.

Police say a fight between two men resulted in one of them stabbing the other Sunday morning.

The man who was stabbed got in an SUV and intentionally ran over the other man accused of inflicting his injuries, according to investigators.

The two men, in their 40s, along with another person in the vehicle were taken to Hennepin County Medical Center. Authorities say the man hit by the SUV later died at the hospital.

The condition of the other man improved and he was arrested on suspicion of murder. The third person injured suffered minor injuries that appeared to be crash related.

55,56,Trump has no coherent strategy to solve the ‘escalating crisis’ with Iran: conservative columnist,Iraq embassy protests: US troops fire tear gas at Iran-backed demonstrators,"On Tuesday — following U.S. military airstrikes in Iraq and Syria — hundreds of supporters of the Iran-backed Shiite militia Kataib Hezbollah (not to be confused with the Hezbollah in Lebanon) angrily stormed the U.S. embassy compound in Baghdad, setting fires and chanting, “Death to America.” The incident was an assertion of growing anti-American sentiment in Iraq, and conservative opinion writer Max Boot asserts in his Washington Post column that President Donald Trump has no real strategy for dealing with Iran.

Boot, one of Trump’s most outspoken critics on the right, recalls that although he was critical of President Barack Obama’s Iran policy in 2015, it was better than Trump’s.

Obama’s deal with Iran, Boot writes, “did nothing to curb Iran’s regional power play and may have even fueled it by lifting economic sanctions — which is why I and others opposed it at the time. But it did at least stop Iran’s development of nuclear weapons. President Trump blundered by exiting the nuclear deal in 2018 and imposing economic sanctions on Iran in 2019, even though it was complying with the agreement.”

The airstrikes in Iran and Syria over the weekend were in response to a missile attack on a military compound near Kirkuk, Iraq on Friday that left a contractor dead. And the airstrikes, Boot notes, “killed 25 members of Kataib Hezbollah.”

“The United States has only two ways out of this escalating crisis: fight or negotiate,” Boot emphasizes. “A war with Iran, as I have previously argued, could be the mother of all quagmires; it could easily spin out of control with tit-for-tat responses of the kind we have seen in recent days. Better to negotiate. That would mean trying to rebuild a tougher nuclear deal in return for the lifting of U.S. sanctions.”







Boot concludes his column by lamenting that things will only get worse for the U.S. in the Middle East if Trump fails to come up with a coherent Iran policy.

“Trump shows little interest in either seriously negotiating or fighting,” Boot laments. “He has waged economic warfare on Iran while doing nothing to curb its regional aggression; indeed, by withdrawing U.S. troops from part of northern Syria, he has allowed an extension of Iranian influence. So, we are left with the worst of all possible worlds: Iran is once again waging a low-intensity conflict, and America once again has no effective response.”","US troops on Wednesday fired tear gas and rubber bullets at hundreds of pro-Iranian militia members who hurled rocks at the US Embassy as a tense standoff in Baghdad entered its second day.

Scores of demonstrators camped outside the embassy overnight after they stormed the heavily fortified Green Zone on Tuesday, chanting “Death to America,” lighting fires at security posts, spraying graffiti on walls and trying to bust through sealed entrances.

US Marines fired tear gas into the crowds that returned on Wednesday and set fire to the roof of a reception area.

At one point, Iraqi soldiers and counterterrorism forces positioned themselves between the militia members and the compound.

The unrest erupted after US jet fighters attacked five bases in Iraq and Syria belonging to the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah over the weekend, killing 25 fighters and wounding dozens more.

The US strike was in retaliation for a rocket attack on an Iraq base by the group that killed an American contractor and wounded four US service members.

President Trump was asked about the escalating situation in Iraq and whether the US was planning on going to war with Iran.

“I don’t think that would be a good idea for Iran. It wouldn’t last very long. Do I want to? No. I want to have peace. I like peace. And Iran should want peace more than anybody. So I don’t see that happening. No, I don’t think Iran would want that to happen. It would go very quickly,” Trump told reporters before a New Year’s Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

The Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of mainly Shiite-aligned militias, including Kataib Hezbollah, called on its supporters to move away from the compound after the Iraqi government said their “message has been heard.”

Mohammed Mohieh, a spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, said the group’s members would not budge until the US ambassador is removed and US troops leave Iraq.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the US would deploy about 750 troops to the Middle East in response to the storming of the embassy.

“This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,” Esper said in a statement. “The United States will protect our people and interests anywhere they are found around the world.”",1.6666666666666667,2.6666666666666665,1.0,2.333333333333333,2.0,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667, Max Boot: U.S. has no real strategy for dealing with Iran .

PALM BEACH - US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he did not foresee war with Tehran, after pro-Iranian demonstrators stormed the US embassy in Iraq.

""I don't see that happening,"" Trump said at his holiday retreat in Florida when a reporter asked about the possibility of war with the Islamic republic.

""I like peace,"" the president said before heading in to New Year's celebrations.

The president spoke after Defense Secretary Mark Esper said that around 750 troops from a rapid response unit of the 82nd Airborne Division were prepared to deploy over the next several days to the Middle East.

The US had already flown a rapid response team of Marines into Baghdad to reinforce its embassy after the attack Tuesday, which left smoke and flames rising from the compound's entrance and further heightened tension between Tehran and Washington.

US officials said there were no plans to evacuate the mission, and no US personnel were reported injured.

The US reinforcements ""got in there very quickly,"" Trump said.

""I think it's been handled very well.""

He added that ""this will not be a Benghazi,"" a reference to an attack in 2012 by radical Islamists on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans were killed inside the smoke-clogged building including the ambassador, Chris Stevens.","Donald Trump speaks to reporters first lady Melania Trump before his New Year's Eve party: AP

Donald Trump has claimed he “likes” North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he hoped the North Korean leader would keep his word by upholding a denuclearisation agreement.

The US president responded to the supreme leader’s latest claim Pyongyang would continue developing nuclear programmes and introduce a “new strategic weapon” – accusing the Trump administration of having “gangster-like demands”.

Speaking told reporters at his new year's eve party at Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trump said: “He likes me, I like him, we get along ... he’s representing his country, I’m representing my country, we have to do what we have to do.

“But he did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearisation ... That was done in Singapore, and I think he’s a man of his word, so we’re going to find out.”

Mr Trump also said he would be happy to have a trial in the US Senate following his impeachment by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. “I don’t really care. It doesn’t matter.”

“As far as I’m concerned I’d be very happy with a trial because we did nothing wrong. The impeachment – I call it impeachment light,” he added, predicting any Senate trial would “go very easy”.

The president suggested he would win the 2020 election comfortably if the media treated him differently. “If you’re honourable I’m going to win the election by a lot. If you’re not honourable I’m just going to win the election by a little. So I’d rather have you be honourable.”

Mr Trump also addressed the attack on the US embassy in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, having earlier said he held Iran responsible.

“I think he’s a man of his word,” Trump says of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pic.twitter.com/bYQLXeBYPA — QuickTake by Bloomberg (@QuickTake) January 1, 2020

Washington drafted in Apache attack helicopters and scores of US Marines to reinforce the embassy compound after storming of the site by Iraqi militia members and their supporters.

“We had some great warriors come in,” said Mr Trump. “This will not be a Benghazi … this will never, ever be a Benghazi,” he added, referring to the deadly attack on a US diplomatic compound in Libya in 2012.

The president has deployed 750 US soldiers to the Middle East, as about 3,000 more are prepared for possible deployment in the next several days.

Mr Trump also said the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising. He was vague about what the plan would entail, but suggested “certain flavours” in cartridge-based e-cigarettes would be taken off the market “for a period of time”.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration would ban the sale of most flavoured e-cigarettes.

57,58,U-19 hero Manjot Kalra suspended in age-fraud case,Robert Pattinson on The Batman: Want to push the character as far as possible,"Your browser does not support the audio element. Your browser does not support the audio element.

Young left-handed opener Manjot Kalra, who scored a hundred in the final of the last edition of U-19 World Cup, has been suspended by outgoing DDCA Ombudsman for one year from playing Ranji Trophy, for an alleged age-fraud during his U-16 and U-19 days. However for the same offence, Delhi senior team vice-captain Nitish Rana has been let off for the time being with more documents being sought to prove that he fudged his age at the junior level. Another U-19 star Shivam Mavi's case has been referred to the BCCI since he now represents Uttar Pradesh in senior cricket.

The outgoing Ombudsman Justice (Retired) Badr Durrez Ahmed passed an order (a copy of which is with PTI) on his final day, preventing Kalra from playing age-group cricket for two years but more importantly denying him a chance to play Ranji Trophy for this season. Kalra, whose age as per BCCI records is 20 years 351 days, last week played for Delhi U-23 against Bengal and scored 80. He was in line to replace senior opener Shikhar Dhawan in the Ranji squad but as it now stands, he will not play any further.

When asked a senior DDCA official, he expressed his helplessness. ""I find it surprising that Manjot Kalra has been punished for the same offence that Nitish Rana is also allegedly guilty of. We couldn't pick Manjot as it was Ombudsman's order. He passed it at 11:30 pm at night, a day before he relinquished office. Now that's a bit bizarre,"" DDCA general secretary Vinod Tihara told PTI.

In case of Rana, former Ombudsman has asked DDCA to enquire from his school DAV Centenary, Narela and seek specific birth-certificate related documents and place before next hearing. But question remains when the old Ombudsman is not there, does it mean new appointee Justice Deepak Verma will conduct fresh enquiry? What everyone is failing to understand is how Kalra can be prevented from playing senior level cricket for age-fraud?

""He has been prevented from playing club matches also. Now his parents will have to appeal for a change of order in front of new Ombudsman. Till then DDCA can't pick him for Ranji Trophy. We are helpless,"" Tihara said. For the Punjab game in Mohali, selectors have picked right-handed middle-order batsman Vaibhav Kandpal and seam bowling all-rounder Siddhant Sharma in the squad of 15 in place of Shikhar Dhawan and Ishant Sharma.

Actor Robert Pattinson says he is looking forward to playing Batman in Matt Reeves' directorial on the DC superhero and wants to push boundaries of the character as far as possible. ""The Batman"" will be fronted by Robert Pattinson as the Caped Crusader.

It’s a proper job, is what I’m saying. And that means proper scares. No spoilers, but the one in the [redacted] when the [redacted] suddenly [redacted] had me clinging to the ceiling. I advise parental supervision at all times. My dad was annoyed at having to come over, but needs must when the devil calls and starts emanating from your screen.

Everything you need is here. A dark, unmappable, labyrinthine castle. Gnarled hands resting on balcony ledges, their unseen owner lurking in shadowy recesses. Terrified locals. Bats. Babies crying. Primal fears inescapably roused.

The story unfolds within two timeframes, the Now and the Then. In the Now, where we begin, a strangely deformed man is being interviewed in a nunnery by Sister Agatha (Dolly Wells) who – and I’m calling it now – is quite the best nun of all time, and not just because she has no time at all for God. “Like many women my age I am trapped in a loveless marriage, maintaining appearances for the sake of a roof over my head,” she says briskly. She is investigating the man’s tale of escape from someone he calls Count Dracula. The man’s name is Jonathan Harker and he is played by John Heffernan with the same utter conviction brought to the story by the rest of the cast via a script and direction that are all refreshingly devoid of any shred of cynicism. You may point, as apparent disproof of my assertion, to Sister Agatha’s response to Harker’s failure to realise the significance of an SOS message written in English in the heart of eastern Europe: “You are an English man,” she explains. “A combination of presumptions beyond compare.” But you would be wrong. She is simply a truth-teller, unfettered by convention. This is quite different. Also, top nunning. I will brook no riposte.

Harker was brought by a fisherman to the nunnery, having been found washed up on the banks of a nearby river muttering about forces of evil. He looks a half-formed thing – bald and white and smooth, a cross between Voldemort and Ryan Reynolds’ irradiated Deadpool – as well, it turns out, he might.

Harker is a lawyer who was sent to talk a mysterious client through some legal issues at his castle. That’s the Then. The client is an unsettling, old, old man with a – Transylvanian, is it? – accent who says exactly the things you want an old, old man with a Transylvanian accent and an unmappable castle to say. Things such as “I don’t drink … wine”, and “The people around here have no flavour”. “Perhaps you mean ‘character’?” suggests Harker gently. “Perhaps,” replies the old, old man. When asked if there is anyone else living in the place, he replies “No. There’s no one … living here.” It is around this point that you find your bum wriggling its way more firmly into the sofa.

The client takes a shine to him, and so Harker must stay. His health fails, he gets weaker by the day – but the years fall away from Dracula until he stands revealed as Danish actor Claes Bang, embodying exactly the wolfish charm and diabolic spirit you love to see in a prince … wait, what am I saying?! The prince of darkness.

It’s a bloodstained love letter to a classic, beautifully and delicately scented with just the faintest hint of ham gothic yarns need; a homage to all the great Counts who have gone before, but still entirely its own thing. And again, like the best of Gatiss and Moffat’s Sherlocks, with the searching intelligence that promises to flesh out the foundational story. Enjoy sinking your teeth into it all.","Dracula

Pictured: Claes Bang as Dracula

On the first day of Veganuary, my TV gave to me, twelve nuns a-bleeding, eleven bats a-feeding, ten ghouls a-shrieking, nine corpses twitching, eight demons drooling, seven wolves a-howling, six crosses burning, five fin-ger-nails...

Four goblets of blood, three dead rats, two stakes through the heart and a vampire baby in a bad mood.

Good luck if you were trying to give up meat for the month.

Dracula (BBC1) was dripping with more gore than a raw hamburger marinaded in pig's blood and garnished with an eyeball.

And that was before the Lord of the Undead decapitated Mother Superior Joanna Scanlan, sending a fountain of vermilion like a geyser across the altar of the convent chapel.

This was a Dracula to delight horror movie fans of all stripes. From the bone-chilling menace of Max Schreck in the silent classic Nosferatu almost 100 years ago, to the sheer camp silliness of Hammer horror's bosomy virgins, it paid homage to them all.

Writers Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat have done this before, reinventing a Victorian masterpiece for a 21st century television audience, with Sherlock.

By taking all the elements they love most from all their favourite versions, the duo salute the past while creating an entirely original vision.

Perhaps seeking to stir up publicity, Gatiss and Moffat had announced that this would be a homoerotic Dracula. It wasn't in the first episode: Exuberantly camp, certainly, but not noticeably gay.

Dracula was dripping with more gore than a raw hamburger marinaded in pig's blood and garnished with an eyeball, writes Christopher Stevens (Pictured: Bang and Dolly Wells as Sister Agatha)

In fact, the script was lovingly sucking up lines from all kinds of treasured movies, feeding off the classics. When naive lawyer Jonathan Harker (John Heffernan) finally realised that his host at a remote Transylvanian castle meant to murder him, he gasped: 'You're a monster!'

'And you're a lawyer,' retorted the Count (Claes Bang). 'Nobody's perfect.'

Any film buff knows that gag is the punchline from Some Like It Hot, which is nobody's idea of a vampire movie.

When a nun armed with a crucifix and a wooden stake tried to drive the dark lord away from the cloister gates, she reminded him he could not withstand the radiance of her Christian goodness.

'Goodness has got nothing to do with it,' smirked Dracula, quoting Mae West.

Bang, one of Denmark's most outstanding actors, was relishing every mouthful of his dialogue.

He began the 90-minute episode, the first of three, in wig and make-up that made him look convincingly ancient though still capable of moving like a bolt of lightning when he caught sight of a mirror in Harker's luggage.

He was rejuvenated within a week, thanks to a diet of fresh claret direct from the jugular, while the lawyer slept.

'You do look rather drained,' the Count sympathised to Harker. Many of the genre's traditions were faithfully observed – the secret passage behind an ancestral portrait, the colony of screaming bats, the skeletal incubus at the bedside.

Perhaps seeking to stir up publicity, Gatiss and Moffat had announced that this would be a homoerotic Dracula

But Gatiss and Moffat gleefully turned others inside out, sometimes literally.

Vampires and werewolves are usually separate species. But, as in the original novel, Dracula was able to take the guise of a wolf – and turned up on all four paws at the convent to which Harker had fled.

Challenged to show himself by a bold nun, he tore his way out of the wolf's entrails, leered at the quivering sisters and lisped: 'I don't know about you, girls, but I do love a bit of fur.'

That bold nun (Dolly Wells) delivered the cleverest twist.

She introduced herself as Sister Agatha, and she wasn't noticeably godly – though a Bride of Christ, she described herself as 'trapped in a loveless marriage for the sake of keeping a roof over my head'.

When she interviewed Harker, who was decomposing before our eyes, she brought along a novice nun as a chaperone and claimed: 'I can't be trusted around men.'

We guessed long before Harker that this novitiate was really his fiancee Mina Murray (Morfydd Clark) in disguise.

What I certainly didn't guess was that Sister Aggie was actually the vampire hunter Van Helsing.

Wells, previously known for her improvised sitcom Doll & Em, was a match at every step for Claes Bang.

This is not a production for delicate souls. There were images of true horror: The broken-jointed corpses climbing out of their packing cases, the hollow-eyed baby lurching forwards to feed on an impaled maiden, and most of all those fingernails... sliding off Harker's hands like loose orange peel.

Aarrghhh! One touch was especially impressive. In the whole hour-and-a-half, we didn't hear a syllable of foul language – blasphemy, certainly, but no obscenities, no four-letter swearwords.

59,60,'The pressure is immense': catching up with Corrie's first black family,Flights: Man condemned for ‘lowest of the low’ deed in airport - should he be arrested?,"This year, Coronation Street shocked fans by introducing the Baileys – its first family of colour after almost 60 years on air. How have they been received?

When it was announced in April that Britain’s longest-running soap, Coronation Street, would be introducing its first black family, the response was one of shock and incredulousness. Lenny Henry simply tweeted “wow” at the news, while theatre director Matthew Xia asked: “How have the producers managed to get away with this for almost 60 years?”

Though Corrie introduced its first black character – Shirley Armitage, played by Lisa Lewis – in 1983, the arrival of the Baileys was a major step forward for the 59-year-old soap, coming almost 30 years after the Taverniers arrived in EastEnders’ Albert Square in 1990. The Bailey family would include the usual mix of high drama and plausibility – patriarch Edison with his gambling addiction, eldest son and wheeler-dealer Michael, youngest son James, a gay footballer, and kindly matriarch Aggie.

“Coronation Street is a national treasure,” says Trevor Michael Georges, who plays Edison, “so when they announced they were looking for their first black family, that marked a real shift in mentality.” Georges has a history in opera and theatre, so Corrie marked a major shift for him, too. “The problem is not being the first of something but paving the way for the second or third,” he says. “That way you build a legacy and when you get to the third iteration, the novelty has worn off so you’re appreciated on your own merits.”

Still, with no precedent to fall back on, it has been tricky. “There is an immense pressure,” he says. “There is no one I can go to for advice. It has been nerve-racking, but we just have to set up the pathway for others to follow.”

With a storyline concerning racism and homophobia in football, Nathan Graham’s character, James, feels especially current. “It’s really important to shine a light on issues happening in the world,” he says. “We need to show all facets of James’s character and not stereotype him. Representation is increasing – but we still need to stay authentic.”

Corrie might be the nation’s favourite soap, but, with viewing figures dropping across the board, there’s hope this injection of diversity will prove an incentive for new viewers to tune in.

“This family has been so welcomed,” says Lorna Laidlaw, who plays Aggie. So many of her friends and family have come back to Corrie because of the Baileys – and she has been contacted by younger BAME actors asking for advice on breaking into the industry. “Acting is really tough and there isn’t enough representation, so this is a role of a lifetime,” she says. “I don’t see why we shouldn’t have more open casting now. Why we can’t have a black lawyer or black businessman on TV, too?”","The shocking moment was caught on film by another traveller, who shared it with Instagram account @PassengerShaming.

In the video, the man can be seen sitting in a waiting area alongside other passengers.

At first, nothing seems out of the ordinary, and the man doesn’t stand out from any other person waiting for their plane to board.

However, he soon turns a few heads when he apparently begins to urinate directly onto the tiled airport floor.

60,61,Business leaders to boost digital innovation,President Trump's plan to curb teen vaping exempts some flavors,"Business leaders in Japan on Wednesday underlined their determination to further boost digital innovation this year as part of efforts for the country to lead the global economy.

In a New Year message, Hiroaki Nakanishi, chairman of the Japan Business Federation, said the country's most influential business lobby known as Keidanren hopes to further develop digital technologies to make people's lives happier and solve social problems.

He said the business lobby will be committed to rule-making for digital transformation and economic structural reforms to address the graying and decreasing population in the country.

Nakanishi also said Keidanren welcomes the entry into force Wednesday of a Japan-U.S. trade deal, which lowers tariffs on farm and industrial goods, agreed on by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President Donald Trump in September.

""We will promote private-sector diplomacy to maintain and strengthen free and open international economic order in the hope of contributing to stability and growth of the global economy,"" Nakanishi said.

Kengo Sakurada, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, called on Japan to take initiative in rule-making on use of digital data and taxation of information technology giants.

""Japan needs to compile its own regulations and rules on digital data ahead of overseas countries,"" Sakurada said. He especially sought deregulation in the fields of online medical services and autonomous driving.

Sakurada also urged Japan to express its determination to reduce greenhouse gas emissions with its cutting-edge technologies.

Akio Mimura, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said it is urgently needed to introduce digital technologies to small and midsize firms across the country to increase their productivity.

To boost the regional economy, Mimura said the chamber aims to make the most of indigenous resources and external demand including inbound travelers to promote local tourism and the tie-up among agricultural, commercial and manufacturing sectors.

WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. health officials will ban most flavored e-cigarettes popular with underage teenagers.

President Donald Trump says the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising, “We’re going to protect our families, we’re going to protect our children, and we’re going to protect the industry.""

But the plan from the Trump administration includes major exceptions that benefit companies that make and sell e-cigarettes and adults who use the nicotine-emitting devices.

Trump was vague about what the plan would entail but suggested “certain flavors” in cartridge-based e-cigarettes would be taken off the market “for a period of time.""

The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday the policy won't affect menthol or tobacco flavors.

The policy also won't affect large, tank-based vaping products sold in vape shops that cater to adults.

Those changes are a major step back from President Donald Trump's original plan announced in September, which would have banned nearly all flavors in all vaping products.

New Year’s with Tiffany Norton

New Hope Cinema Grill

Tiffany Norton, who has been the queen of New Year’s Eve in New Hope for years, will take the headliner slot for this big year-end show. Norton has been one of the most impressive comedy stories of the past decade, transforming from part-time performer to must-see headliner at night, all while waking up early as part of KS95’s morning show. This show is definitely worth the drive out to the ‘burbs. 8:30 p.m. $19. 2749 Winnetka Ave. N., New Hope; 763-417-0017.

New Year’s Eve Comedy and Dance Party

Dance Love Studio

Why choose between comedy, dancing, and partying into the New Year? Dance Love Studio will have the best of all three on New Year’s Eve, with comedians Ali Sultan, Greg Coleman, Shawn Nasfstad, and Abenezer Merdassa providing the jokes. Sultan and Coleman are two of the most seasoned headliners in town, and both are worth the price of admission on their own. Meanwhile, Nafstad and Merdassa are two of the fastest-rising up-and-coming voices in comedy, and will likely find themselves headlining their own New Year’s Eve shows in 2020. Get there early, as the comedy will get the party started for the evening at 9 p.m. From there, you can get up and move with a mini dance lesson from Hanna Esparza, then hit the open floor starting at 10:45 p.m. with DJ Salman and DJ Luv. You’ll be able to countdown to the New Year at midnight, celebrate with a toast, sloppily hug and high-five everyone, and then keep the party going until 2 a.m. 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. $20/$30 at the door. 2601 Second Ave. S., Minneapolis.

East Coast-Style New Year’s Eve

Sisyphus Brewing

For anyone who loves to celebrate but also likes going to bed a reasonable time, Maggie Faris has your back. Faris is once again presenting her East Coast-Style New Year’s Eve event, with a stacked lineup of comedians and plenty of surprises. The best part? Each show ends with a full-blown New Year’s countdown (the late show ends at 11 p.m., or midnight on the East Coast -- get it?), with champagne and confetti and all the pomp and circumstance you could ask for $25 bucks. This year’s shows will feature Faris, alongside Amber Preston, who made her mark as an Acme regular before taking over Los Angeles the past several years, and headliner David Dyer, who is best known as part of the Bob and Tom radio show. One of the staples of Faris’ events has become her affinity for booby prizes, and this year’s East Coast blowout will be no exception. Trust us, they will be ridiculous. There are two sets, giving you plenty of time to get home and relieve the babysitter before the “real” parties start, or sneak off to another bar to watch the ball drop and countdown to midnight for real. 7 and 9 p.m. $25. 712 Ontario Ave. W., Minneapolis; 612-444-8674.

Also, these comedy shows are recommended by City Pages writers:



Lizz Winstead: Sharknado X

The Cedar Cultural Center

When recounting the entire history of civilization, the last 10 years is just a blip. But when you’re living through a decade of political malaise, cultural anxiety, economic uncertainty, and environmental deterioration, things can feel like a series of escalating catastrophes. Thankfully Lizz Winstead, the socially astute comic who co-created satirical news staple The Daily Show, has been here all the while to provide cathartic laughter at her popular New Year’s Eve retrospectives. In recapping a 365 days worth of absurdities, Winstead brings an insightful perspective, infusing the most exasperating events with much needed levity. That said, even Winstead’s formidable comic skills are certain to be tested when consolidating an entire irrational decade into one hilarious presentation. Winstead, accompanied by guitarist Sam Breckenridge, will evoke laughter from this period of prolonged tension, hopefully imbuing a bit of hope as we enter a new decade. 7:30 p.m. $50/$60; $70 VIP. 416 Cedar Ave. S., Minneapolis; 612-338-2674. --Brad Richason

Sean Donnelly

Rick Bronson's House of Comedy

“I’m newly divorced, which is a bit of a bummer. But I’m doing good,” says comedian Sean Donnelly. “I just did a spot on Tracy Morgan’s show, The Last O.G., playing a security guard, and I’ve been doing tons of standup as usual.” Onstage, Donnelly is talking about everything from U.F.O.s to social media. “I had A.D.D. as a kid,” he says of the latter. “Social media is like my brain, but as a collective unit. After a few days, we can’t remember what we were upset about or who we were mad at.” Donnelly reckons we’re headed back to 1996 as people back away from social media. “I already see it happening. People say, ‘I check my email and maybe look up a recipe.’ Even the tech companies have caught on, offering features that let you lock yourself out of the internet for awhile.” He likens it to how bars were years ago. “They used to say in bars, ‘No politics or religion.’ I think that’s kind of good. I’m not saying we can’t talk about things, but we can still be friends and have different opinions. Family members are unfriending each other. People need to chill out. One thing doesn’t define a person.” 7 and 10 p.m. $25-$55.95. 408 E. Broadway, Mall of America, Bloomington; 952-858-8558. --P.F. Wilson

Bengt Washburn

Acme Comedy Co.

“I’m in an airport in Costa Rica,” Bengt Washburn tells us. “I did a cruise ship gig last week and this is where I get off.” For years, working the boats, as they say, wasn’t the most desirable gig in comedy, but Washburn says times have changed. “I don’t mind it,” he says. “Older audiences now are pretty hip. When I first started, they didn’t know what standup was. Now, if you have an audience of 50 and 60 year olds, they know who Carlin is; they get it.” Washburn doesn’t work blue, but there are still things that seem otherwise innocuous that he can’t joke about on ships. “I still do clubs. That’s where I do the writing,” he says. His PG/PG-13 style earned him two specials on Dry Bar Comedy, a website and production company that favors clean standup. “My last special for them was called Not Bad,” he explains. “At Acme, I’ll be doing the ‘Sort of Bad’ show. It’s all the stuff from Not Bad, but not truncated. It goes a little further.” For example, he’ll be able to touch on some social and political topics that he couldn’t do at sea. “That would start a fight on a ship,” he adds. “But it would be pretty funny given the age group. Someone would tip over and die.” 8 and 10:30 p.m. $30; $60 with dinner. 708 N. First St., Minneapolis; 612-338-6393. --P.F. Wilson

Heart of the City Music Factory, 2665 Fourth Ave., Anoka; 612-990-6192.","When I was a kid, New Year’s Eve night was one of my favorites. My parents and I would gather with one or two of my uncle’s families. It was the only night of the year we could hang out until midnight. The evening was spent making confetti out of colored paper, getting our homemade noise-makers of pans and wooden ladles ready, and setting the stage so we could scream and yell the New Year into existence.

The television was always on, of course, bouncing between the various New Year’s celebrations being covered on the networks. Anyone who was doing the same thing with their family this year may have been treated to Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen discussing a story about Cooper’s mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, wondering if she was going to be asked who had the largest “cock” in Hollywood.

No big deal, right? It’s 2020. Old sensibilities are out and penis stories are in. Sorry, but no. That’s not how this works. The constant virtue signaling by mainstream media prohibits us from dismissing when they decide inappropriate things are suddenly appropriate.

As Twitter celebrity Carpe Donktum noted, the hypocrisy at CNN, Cooper’s home network, is thick.

One of the biggest threats of Cultural Marxism is taking things that are rightly considered inappropriate and normalizing them for children in modern society. Have most kids heard worse than, “He’s not going to ask me who has the biggest cock in Hollywood, is he?” Yes. Does that make it okay for Anderson Cooper to ask it live on CNN on New Year’s Eve night. No. When we accept such things without objection, we’re acknowledging that the Cultural Marxists have already won.

Revelry is no excuse for retelling of adult stories on live television. Anderson Cooper stepped in it on this one, but we shouldn’t expect anything from CNN. Not an apology. Not even an acknowledgement. We need to set a better tone for 2020.

The alarming rate of out-of-school children in the country has continued to draw concern and intervention from all fronts, among which is the annual National Literary Competition, launched in 2014 by Lafarge Africa to create more literacy enhancement opportunities for indigent students across Nigeria. According to the company, promoting literacy and education has proven to be an eﬀective approach to alleviating poverty and improving the well-being of a society, as well as achieving equality and fostering sustainable development.

However it cited a UNESCO report, which stated that globally, approximately 758 million adults (15 per cent of global population) remain illiterate with women constituting two-third and Sub-Saharan Africa home to 26 per cent of world’s illiteracy rate. “In Nigeria, it is estimated that just a little above half of the adult population is literate (about 57 per cent), while youth literacy rate is less than 70 per cent.

“Yet, rates vary hugely between states, regions and sex. An in-depth survey by the National Bureau of Statistics reveal that Imo and Lagos States record the highest number of English literate adults at 80.8 per cent and 80.5 per cent respectively, while Sokoto State has only 22.1 per cent of its adult population literate in English Language. According to the 2010 National Literacy Survey, urban literacy surpasses rural at a huge ratio of 69.4 per cent to 38.5 per cent, while 65.1 per cent of males are literate as opposed to 50.6 per cent females.

“These estimates reveal that approximately 65 million Nigerians still remain illiterate, while over 10 million children are out of school (UNICEF 2014).” Thus with support of the Ovie Brume Foundation (OBF) and State Universal Basic Education Boards (SUBEB), the Lafarge Africa National Literacy Competition was launched in 2014 as an annual contest conducted at the state, regional and national levels. After being coached in spelling, pronunciation, essay writing, and summary writing using specially developed study guides, select pupils compete in a state run-oﬀ, which sees two candidates (one male and one female) emerge to compete at the regional levels. The winning regions then proceed to the grand ﬁnale, where six winners emerge.

The competition also aims at enabling pupils to further enhance their language and vocabulary skills with the overall goal of enhancing the participants’ literacy skills (reading, writing, pronunciation and spelling) and improving their educational opportunities. It features reading assessment test- a questionnaire of 40 objective questions in English Language; summary writing, written at respective venues; essay writing also written at respective venues; Spelling Bee – a spelling- off competition across primary schools in 374 local government areas in Nigeria.

The initiative started in 2014 as ‘Reading Project’- a community integrated literacy enhancement initiative across ﬁve locations (Ewekoro, Sagamu, Onne, Ashaka and Lagos). where Lafarge Africa employees under the Lafarge friends of Communities (FOC) go into schools and read with pupils and support them on literacy; 950 story books were distributed across ﬁve locations to reach 250 beneﬁciaries. The initiative recorded an increase in the literacy skills of beneﬁciaries ranging from 9 per cent to 63 per cent.

The phase II was implemented across ﬁve locations – Ewekoro, Sagamu, Onne, Ashaka and Lagos; it was implemented in ﬁve schools across the aforementioned project sites and the target was to increase by at least 25 per cent the literacy skills of 500 primary school children in communities where Lafarge Africa operates. A total of 668 pupils were exposed to literacy intervention and 234 were reached.

Since the inception of the initiative, the company said there have been remarkable improvements in literacy skills among beneﬁciary primary school pupils across the country. By 2016, it said a total of 77,144 primary school pupils were reached in 244 local government areas, of which the 1,465 who actively participated in the competition remarkably displayed the ability to spell quickly, accurately and with comprehension, due to the contents of the initiative.

The maiden edition of the competition was won by students from Akwa Ibom State, while Ondo and Bauchi States came second and third respectively. In the 2015 edition, participants from Rivers, Lagos and Kogi States came first, second and third positions respectively. For the 2016 edition, Lagos, Plateau and Enugu States produced the first, second and third place winners.

In the 2017 edition of the competition, Edo State came first, while Ondo and Kano States came second and third respectively. In 2018, Lagos State emerged winner, while Ebonyi and Gombe States came second and third respectively. In the 2019 competition with the theme ‘Bridging the Literacy Gap Together’, Master David Emmanuella and Miss Barikpoa Prosper from Community Primary School, Rivers State emerged winner, while Ogun and Enugu States came second and third respectively. The winners were awarded scholarships, trophies and various gifts.

The grand finale event, which attracted key stakeholders from the public and private sectors, was also an opportunity for the children to engage and interact among themselves, explore various book exhibition stands, take reading sessions and also participate in a spelling bee competition.

Speaking at the event, which held in Lagos, the Chairman of Lafarge Africa Plc, Mr. Mobolaji Balogun said: “Literacy is crucial to the development of any society and it is described by UNESCO as a driver for sustainable development in that it enables greater participation in the labour market. It improves child and family health and nutrition, reduces poverty and expands life opportunities.”

He said that as an organisation, Lafarge Africa continues to invest in educational interventions, including scholarship and bursary awards for children within its host communities, training programmes, renovation and construction of classroom blocks and other facilities within schools, computer training, skills acquisition programmes among others.

“For a country like Nigeria, there is an urgent need to work towards securing a sustainable future. We believe that a sustainable future will enable growth, global peace and security and technological advancement. We need to prepare our children for a future where they will compete globally with ease. That future begins with improving the literacy levels of every child in Nigeria today,” he said.

The Country Chief Executive Officer, Lafarge Africa, Mr. Michel Puchercos, who commended all the students that participated at every stage of the competition, said “it is rewarding to watch these brilliant children grow and improve every year. We dream of a bright future for every Nigerian child through basic education.

“Six years on, the visible outcomes we have seen encourage us to do more. We have touched the lives of more than 700,000 primary school pupils in 1,665 schools across 544 local government areas. The competition is delivered across all 109 senatorial districts in all 36 states of the federation and the FCT and is organised with the support of the SUBEBs in all the states, with our implementing partners- Ovie Brume Foundation and TEP Centre.”

Puchercos added: “As a company, we are proud of this achievement and do believe that it will inspire more well-meaning Nigerians and citizens all over Africa and the world to contribute to improving the lives of the people around them in any way they can.”

The special guest of honour, the Emir of Kano, Muhammad Sanusi II, commended the company for taking up the initiative to bridge the country’s widening literacy gap. He expressed his passion for children and women and urged more companies to join hands against illiteracy. “We spend a lot on government and infrastructure, but there isn’t enough being spent on education for children.”

Emphasising reasons for the initiative by Lafarge, the Communications, Public Affairs and Sustainable Development Director, Lafarge Africa, Folashade Ambrose-Medebem said: “We have been doing this successfully for the past six years and we are quite happy with the positive impact we have made so far. This year, we are excited to have existing and new partners on board with us, like the British Council, Sterling Bank and Oando Foundation. We look forward to what we will achieve together. We believe that as we continue on this journey, there is room for more partnerships as there is still a lot to be done. The literacy competition is part of our overall sustainable development strategy; our sustainability ambitions which have four pillars- climate and energy, circular economy, environment and community- each with specific actions and targets to ensure we achieve them.’’ she said.

According to the Sustainable Development and Corporate Brand Manager, Titilope Oguntuga: “Lafarge Africa’s annual National Literacy Competition is an intervention in Nigeria’s education sector in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal four, which focuses on ensuring inclusive quality education and learning opportunities for all. It is also part of the company’s overall sustainability ambition hinged on four pillars, including climate and energy, circular economy, environment, and community. Our annual National Literacy Competition sits under the community pillar.”

Oguntuga said over the past six years, the company has continued to introduce new ideas as a way of improving the competition and making it bigger. “This year, we introduced the computer based testing (CBT) for the first time as a mode of assessment. The tests include a reading assessment exam using a questionnaire of forty objective questions, summary writing, essay writing and an off competition spelling bee.”

Responding, the overall winners, who also got scholarships to complete their secondary education, thanked the company and expressed delight at the opportunity to participate and the joy of emerging winners.","The business of selling consumer goods and services online is a relatively young endeavor across Africa, but ecommerce is set to boom.

Over the last eight years, the sector has seen its first phase of big VC fundings, startup duels and attrition.

To date, scaling e-commerce in Africa has straddled the line of challenge and opportunity, perhaps more than any other market in the world. Across major African economies, many of the requisites for online retail — internet access, digital payment adoption, and 3PL delivery options — have been severely lacking.

Still, startups jumped into this market for the chance to digitize a share of Africa’s fast growing consumer spending, expected to top $2 billion by 2025.

African e-commerce 2.0 will include some old and new players, play out across more countries, place more priority on internet services, and see the entry of China.

But before highlighting several things to look out for in the future of digital-retail on the continent, a look back is beneficial.

Jumia vs. Konga

The early years for development of African online shopping largely played out in Nigeria (and to some extent South Africa). Anyone who visited Nigeria from 2012 to 2016 likely saw evidence of one of the continent’s early e-commerce showdowns. Nigeria had its own Coke vs. Pepsi-like duel — a race between ventures Konga and Jumia to out-advertise and out-discount each other in a quest to scale online shopping in Africa’s largest economy and most populous nation.

Traveling in Lagos traffic, large billboards for each startup faced off across the skyline, as their delivery motorcycles buzzed between stopped cars.

Covering each company early on, it appeared a battle of VC attrition. The challenge: who could continue to raise enough capital to absorb the losses of simultaneously capturing and creating an e-commerce market in notoriously difficult conditions.

In addition to the aforementioned challenges, Nigeria also had (and continues to have) shoddy electricity.

Both Konga — founded by Nigerian Sim Shagaya — and Jumia — originally founded by two Nigerians and two Frenchman — were forced to burn capital building fulfillment operations most e-commerce startups source to third parties.

That included their own delivery and payment services (KongaPay and JumiaPay). In addition to sales of goods from mobile-phones to diapers, both startups also began experimenting with verticals for internet based services, such as food-delivery and classifieds.

While Jumia and Konga were competing in Nigeria, there was another VC driven race for e-commerce playing out in South Africa — the continent’s second largest and most advanced economy.

E-tailers Takealot and Kalahari had been jockeying for market share since 2011 after raising capital in the hundreds of millions of dollars from investors Naspers and U.S. fund Tiger Global Management.

So how did things turn out in West and Southern Africa? In 2014, the lead investor of a flailing Kalahari — Naspers — facilitated a merger with Takealot (that was more of an acquisition). They nixed the Kalahari brand in 2016 and bought out Takelot’s largest investor, Tiger Global, in 2018. Takealot is now South Africa’s leading e-commerce site by market share, but only operates in one country.

In Nigeria, by 2016 Jumia had outpaced its rival Konga in Alexa ratings (6 vs 14), while out-raising Konga (with backing of Goldman Sachs) to become Africa’s first VC backed, startup unicorn. By early 2018, Konga was purchased in a distressed acquisition and faded away as a competitor to Jumia.

Jumia went on to expand online goods and services verticals into 14 Africa countries (though it recently exited a few) and in April 2019 raised over $200 million in an NYSE IPO — the first on a major exchange for a VC-backed startup operating in Africa.

Jumia’s had bumpy road since going public — losing significant share-value after a short-sell attack earlier in 2019 — but the continent’s leading e-commerce company still has heap of capital and generates $100 million in revenues (even with losses).",2.0,3.6666666666666665,2.6666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667,3.6666666666666665," The annual National Literary . of the . annual National .

GET THE SHOW ON THE ROAD: Long-time roadie in the Australian live entertainment business, Howard Freeman.

THE life of a roadie is an unusual one.

But it is a life Howard Freeman wouldn't change for the world.

He has set up and pulled down monumentally large stages for some of the biggest bands on the planet.

And with his loyal roadie mates, he then drives interstate overnight and does it all again.

Matt Collins: You are one of Australia longest serving roadies. That must be a proud badge to have?

Howard Freeman: Yeah, I can remember being four or five-years-old and going into a band room. My father had a holiday resort in Melbourne and he had a big band playing. Every year he would hold ballroom dances through the summer because pubs would close at 6 o'clock. The same year I remember my father shooting a guy in the knee who was coming up the stairs to rob us.

MC: All that when you were five?

HF: Yeah, no wonder I wanted to leave home in a hurry.

MC: How did you go in your school days? Did you enjoy school?

HF: At Caulfield Grammar, where my father spent a lot of money getting me educated, I got the lowest score in maths ever recorded in the history of education.

MC: Another proud moment.

HF: Yeah, but that was at 15 and I worked out recently in my last AC/DC concert my budget was $6.5 million, so I faked it pretty good.

MC: Let's talk about some of the huge names you have worked with. Who was the first big act?

HF: The most memorable human being to me was Billy Thorpe. When he started playing rock, he did a song at my venue once called, Cigarettes, whiskey and wild, wild woman. I was 18 at the time and I listened to the lyrics and went, 'yeah this for me'.

MC: Your first tour manager job was for a great Aussie band, Sherbet.

HF: Yeah and back then nobody knew what a touring manager did. I had a security business in Melbourne and I could count money, so I could handle myself and I was probably reasonable company then. I had hair and hips and half a brain.

MC: That was all the resume you needed.

HF: Absolutely.

MC: Explain to me what 24 hours looks like for roadie.

HF: It depends what era you are speaking. In the 80s it could be behind the wheel of a four-tonne truck driving overnight from Brisbane to Sydney after you've loaded out at 2am. You may find a hamburger on the way, you'd be drinking scotch or Bundy, you're probably smoking a joint and you could've done a line of speed. You'd arrive at approximately 1pm the next afternoon. You'd carry the gear upstairs, you'd set up and everyone would hate you because you haven't showered. And you'd probably do that again in Melbourne the night after.

MC: So why do it? What's the appeal?

HF: You do it for the people you love and work with, which is the band you represent. Somebody asked me, what was the greatest drug I had ever had. I said, when the house lights go down and the band starts playing music.

That doesn't matter whether it's a suburban pub with 20 people, or in a stadium with 100,000 people. You've built it and they have come.","At least eight more people have been killed in catastrophic bushfires in Australia this week, bringing the death toll to 18, according to local reports.

Authorities are warning conditions will only get worse, with temperatures expected to exceed 115 degrees in some part of the country this weekend.

Out-of-control fires have raged for the past two months across Australia’s east coast, destroying at least 900 homes, killing half a billion animals and wiping out 30 percent of the country’s koala population, officials said.

Residents on Wednesday described scenes “like Armageddon” — the massive infernos razing homes, blanketing towns in thick toxic smoke and turning skies to a menacing blood red, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Among the dead are a father and son who stayed behind to defend their property, three young firefighters killed in the line of duty and two men who were discovered in burnt-out cars.

Large plumes of ash from the fire have now drifted as far as New Zealand — locals in the city of Queenstown on Tuesday sharing photos on social media of the thick orange haze and noting they could smell the smoke.

Images of trapped Australians wearing face masks and sheltering on beaches on New Years’s Eve went viral around the world this week, while Prime Minister Scott Morrison faced a groundswell of fury over his tepid response to the disaster.

With a heat wave predicted for later this week, authorities issued evacuation orders for large stretches of the New South Wales’ coast normally teeming with holidaymakers over the summer vacation period.

Long queues formed outside supermarkets and gas stations on Wednesday as stranded tourists and residents attempted to stock up on supplies, the Herald reported.

More than 50,000 residents on the New South Wales coast are currently without power while some towns no longer have access to clean drinking water, the report said.

Firefighters have struggled to contain the massive blazes — the worst in decades — with record temperatures and a prolonged drought exacerbating the disaster.",2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5," Howard Freeman is a long-time roadie in the Australian live entertainment business, Howard Freeman .

64,65,The joy audit: how to have more fun in 2020,How to succeed at your New Year’s resolutions this year,"This is the year to start taking happiness seriously. But how – and where do you find the time? Here are the tips and advice you need for a pleasure-filled year

The last time I felt joy was at an event that would be many people’s vision of hell: a drunken Taylor Swift club-night singalong in the early hours of the morning a few weekends ago.

I certainly experience joy, either as peaks of euphoria or in quiet, unexpected bursts. But as I go about my everyday business – sprinting to meet deadlines, standing in front of the open fridge – I wouldn’t say it looms large.

I am not alone. Many of us treat joy like the good china, only warranted on special occasions. Even if we know it is within our reach, we may not see it is within our control.

But this is a mistake, according to happiness experts. Nataly Kogan, the author of Happier Now, says: “Happiness and emotional health are not extras, or bonuses, or nice-to-haves – they’re actually at the core of what helps us live well.”

Seeking joy may sound frivolous, but being happy has been shown to promote habits and behaviours that are important to our health. A 2017 study of roughly 7,000 adults found that those with positive wellbeing were more likely to be physically active and to eat fresh fruit and vegetables. Being happy has also been linked to better sleep, better weight management, lower stress levels, an improved immune system and even increased life expectancy.

Despite the myriad benefits of joy – and the obvious incentive that it feels good – many of us don’t prioritise it. But experts point out that our resources and energy are finite; what we put off will fall by the wayside. So, as with any goal, the first step to a joyful life is to make it a priority – which may mean you need to let go of other commitments – and then do the work. In other words, we need to start taking joy seriously.

As the founder and chief executive of the wellbeing business Happier, Kogan helps companies to improve their workplace culture and professionals to foster joy in their lives – lessons born out of her experience of career burnout and personal dissatisfaction in her late 30s. She likens herself at the time to a ship on the ocean – fine in favourable conditions, but at the mercy of any storm.

Now 44 and based with her family in Boston, Massachusetts, Kogan says she has landed on practices and tools to harness happiness as a steady, sustainable presence in her daily life. The first of these is not to think of happiness as something to pursue at a later date, when your life is in order. “I lived with this idea of: ‘I’ll be happy when ...’ as I know so many people do,” she says. “We have to look at emotional health as a skill, not a destination. And, as with any skill, when you practise, you do better.”

The gains have been established in research into baseline happiness – what in psychological literature is called our “hedonic set point”. It varies from person to person, but the key point is that our baseline is only half determined by genetics. “That means the other 50% is up to us,” says Kogan. “I think that is incredibly empowering.”

So, what can we do to make 2020 a more joyful year?

Identify the problem

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Draw a large circle, divide it into segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess.’ Illustration: Adam Higton/The Guardian

Start by identifying where joy is most lacking. Sarah Waite, a London-based psychologist, suggests the “wheel of life”, a personal development exercise derived from the Buddhist theory of balance. Draw a large circle, divide it into eight or 10 segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess.

There are templates online, typically along the lines of fun and recreation, physical environment, career, finances, personal growth, romance, family and friends, and health. Shade in each wedge to reflect your level of satisfaction.

The finished circle should be an overview of the areas of your life that you feel you have under control, and those that may need further attention. When it comes to deciding where to allocate resources, “it’s not necessarily the one you’ve marked the lowest; it’s the one you really value the most,” says Waite. It may be that your job is not a priority for you, so it doesn’t matter if it remains only two-thirds filled.

The goal is to get perspective and clarity. The brain has evolved to be much more sensitive to negatives than positives as, historically, it has been more important for us to be attuned to hazardous situations than satisfactory ones. This “negativity bias” distorts our perspective, meaning it is hard to make a good decision under stress, says Kogan. “People can focus on things that are not ‘as they should be’ … We all have our stories of why we are not happy, at work or otherwise.” But small, practical steps taken to boost joy in one part of life can improve happiness across the board as momentum builds.

The big picture

Kogan’s first tip is to start by writing a list of what you like about your job, no matter how small. “Be specific, think broadly and don’t judge your list as you write it.” It doesn’t matter what they are, or how many there are; the idea is to shift your mindset.

Kogan suggests making it a daily habit to note three small, highly specific things that you are grateful for every morning, perhaps before you reach for your phone. “It’s not about pretending that nothing is wrong, it’s about helping your brain to get out of that negativity spiral.”

Just three weeks of this consistent “gratitude practice” has been shown to establish new neuron connections facilitating optimism, with the effects lasting for six months. Mindfulness and self-compassion are similarly powerful, says Shamash Alidina, the author of Mindfulness for Dummies and the co-founder of the not-for-profit Museum of Happiness – and more attainable than people may think.

Many equate mindfulness with clearing one’s mind of thoughts entirely. This means they often give up out of frustration, says Alidina – but “it’s not about not thinking, it’s about being aware”. Spending just a few minutes noticing your thoughts pass you by like clouds, experimenting with what Alidina calls your “flexibility of attention”, can equip you to stop negative spirals before they start. “People associate meditation with being calm or relaxed, but it’s really just about not getting lost in your thoughts,” he says.

What does it all mean?

Finding lasting happiness is also about what we do, particularly what we do for others. Kogan says it is important to have a sense of purpose – to find what she calls “the bigger why” among our deadlines and meetings. “It’s not possible to be a happy human being if you don’t feel like what you’re doing is meaningful,” she says.

Assessing your to-do list – particularly tasks you find mundane or frustrating – through the lens of “Who does this help?” can increase motivation, lift your mood and improve your ability to manage stress, she says. “When you say: ‘This project is going to help a lot of people’ – my team, customers, readers, whatever – your stress has context and you feel more resilient getting through it.”

Helping others may seem like a circular way of boosting your happiness, but Kogan says even small gestures, such as pulling out a chair for a colleague or checking in with them about their day, releases oxytocin in the giver and the receiver. Over time, it also fosters a sense of belonging at work and can lead to office friendships – one of the most common factors in job satisfaction.

Play is an effective mood‑booster that is often neglected in adulthood

The mindset shift encouraged by practising “intentional kindness” means it is worth doing for your own happiness, says Kogan. At 3pm every day, she receives a reminder to “be kind”. Sometimes that is as simple as texting someone she hasn’t spoken to in a while and telling them that she’s thinking of them: “I cannot tell you how much that means to people.”

Family fortunes

It is well known that strong relationships are important to happiness, but what those look like – and how to forge them – can be ambiguous. “Happiness can feel very abstract,” says Gretchen Rubin, the author of The Happiness Project. “My approach is to think about what you want, then break it up into manageable, concrete actions that you can actually take.”

In terms of improving relationships, that might look like making a regular time to call or meet a friend, committing to attend a reunion or throw a party, or having a daily exchange with someone in public. Every five days or so, Rubin’s family email each other an update on the “boring everyday stuff” of their lives, freed from any pressure to entertain or an expectation to reply. “We realised that, by staying in touch with the little minutiae, we would feel more connected – and it’s absolutely working.”

Making warm greetings and goodbyes habitual at home is another small but effective shift (“I always think that I don’t want to be less enthusiastic than my dog,” says Rubin). Such low-level commitments are less daunting to start and easier to keep up – and they make a real impact. We all have different definitions of happiness, Rubin says, whether it be joy, peace, satisfaction, bliss. “My way of thinking about it is: today, next month, next year – are there things you can do to be happier?” she says. “And if there are, why not do them?”

Home truths

If Rubin comes across an improvement at home that she can make in less than a minute, she does it immediately. For her, “outer order contributes to inner calm”, so happiness can be as simple as a clean kitchen bench or a decluttered shelf. “It feels trivial – and yet over and over people say: ‘When I have control of my environment, I feel like I have control generally,’” says Rubin. “Like making your bed every morning – it gives people a lift, more than really makes sense.”

Often this is understood as minimalism – but there are many happy, successful people who take pleasure in being surrounded by their possessions, says Rubin. It is not a moral failing to prefer abundance, and making your personal space reflect your values and interests “can be very pleasing”.

Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of The Aesthetics of Joy, agrees. “We’ve been taught to think about our homes through the lens of other people: what’s trendy, what the design books say,” she says. As a result, many of us are out of touch with how our spaces measure on our own “joy meters”. We may view a neutral grey palette as the height of sophistication when, in fact, what brings us pleasure is a neon front door.

Even the presence of different shapes can have an impact, with people finding angular objects more subconsciously anxiety-inducing than round ones. Rounded objects also tend to make environments more playful, says Lee: “Not only because your mind is unconsciously set at ease, but because you’re less worried about bumping into sharp edges.”

Play is an effective mood-booster that is often neglected in adulthood. Rubin says she marks holidays such as Halloween and St Patrick’s Day with themed meals, just because, while the Museum of Happiness’s pop-up installations in London and Manchester later this month are testament to the transformative effects of a ballpit on otherwise sober adults.

To bring some of that spirit into your home, Lee advises trying to imagine you are visiting for the first time: “Notice how it makes you feel, almost the physiological sensation in your body, as you move from room to room. What are the things that, when your eyes land on them, make you smile or feel drained?”

The key is not to feel burdened by your possessions. “Owning less means you are surrounding yourself with only your favourite things,” says Joshua Becker, who writes the blog Becoming Minimalist. Being intentional with the things that we own – and, by extension, our money – means that our lives align with our values and passions: things that really matter to us. “Minimalism removes distractions so that we can free up our money, time and energy on those things that bring us real joy in life,” says Becker.

Early to bed

Play, gratitude and kindness may factor into a life full of joy, but so can discipline. A sense of control is more important to happiness than many people realise, says Rubin. Prosaically enough, this is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management. Too often, happiness is located solely in the moment, she says, when it could be achieved through giving up sugar or alcohol, or setting an alarm to go to bed on time. “Sometimes, to be happier in the long run, we have to ask more of ourselves or deprive ourselves of something,” says Rubin. “A happy life is not one that’s focused only on the present.”

Embracing boredom

In the same vein, putting off a difficult or boring task can detract from your daily experience more than getting stuck into it. Waite says she rolls her eyes at the framing of self-care as “baths and candles”: “I love those things, but if doing your tax return is really making you anxious, maybe the kindest thing you can do for yourself is to make a start.” It may not be what is typically understood by joy, but sustainable, long-lasting happiness involves recognising that there are many shades on the emotional palette.

Research shows that occasionally accepting the presence of harder emotions means you experience them less intensely and for less time. In fact, the first step towards a joyful life may be letting go of your ideas of what that looks like – and recognising that it is down to you.

“Part of this exercise is to recognise that there isn’t anything out there that is going to make you feel good 100% of the time,” says Kogan. “That’s actually great news, because when we let go of this particular idea of happiness we give ourselves more opportunities to be in alignment with our lives.”","× How to succeed at your New Year’s resolutions this year

NEW YORK — Do you want to eat better, exercise more, stop vaping or lose weight?

Great. Now’s the time to set those New Year’s resolutions.

As we head into a year — and a new decade — your first step is to believe you can do it.

The opposite is also true, said University of Scranton psychology professor John C. Norcross, who has studied resolutions for decades. If you think you can’t do it, you’ll likely prove yourself right.

While about 40% of Americans set resolutions around January 1, about 40% to 44% of them will be successful at six months, said Norcross, reporting his results from multiple studies with colleagues.

But if you believe in yourself, you are 10 times more likely to change via a New Year’s resolution, compared to non-resolvers, when both groups have comparable goals and motivation, he reported.

Here’s how to start yourself on the strongest possible footing this year.

Make it specific

Eating better and exercising more are all nice ideas, but they’re too general and don’t give you a plan of action. People often think they lack motivation when the problem is really a lack of clarity, wrote author James Clear in his book, “Atomic Habits.”

“The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION],” writes Clear.

If you want to eat better, be specific: Resolve to add a fruit or vegetable to your lunch every day, limit fast food to once per week, or have dessert once a week.

Make it possible

Avoid resolutions that sound great but are unattainable. In fact, make them them something you will enjoy. They can still be hard, but that doesn’t mean they have to make you miserable.

To eat better, put that bowl of fruit right next to your lunch bag, so you grab an apple or orange every day. Hate apples? Don’t pick apples. Pick a fruit you are likely to eat.

To exercise more, you might want to run more. But if you’re a night person, don’t make it harder on yourself by trying to run every morning before work, said Gretchen Rubin, author of “The Happiness Project.” Do it after work.

Want to meditate? Great. Rubin hates meditating, so she stopped doing it. It’s ok to experiment and stop doing things you don’t like. “Know who you are, and who you’re not,” she said.

Allow yourself to fail

Everyone screws up. Expect to have occasional slips. But don’t let the occasional missed exercise class or Friday workplace donut throw you off course, explained Norcross.

Most successful resolvers slip in January, but 71% of successful resolvers say their first slip strengthened their efforts through a combination of guilt, increasing awareness of their problem’s severity, and the slip reminding them to refine their plans, he said.

If you know you’re walking into a high pressure situation, practice saying “no thanks” to your aunt’s apple pie in advance. Even people who don’t like apple pie sometimes still eat it when offered just to be polite. Instead, practice saying “No, thank you.”

And if you do slip? Focus on getting back on track, not the slip. “The people who show more compassion for themselves are more likely to get back on the horse and try again,” Rubin said.

Set yourself up for success

See what they tell you: If you’re resolved to spend less time on your phone but grab it as soon as you wake up, put your phone in another room at night. Oh, it’s your alarm, you say? Buy an alarm clock. They cost $6 now.

If you want to limit sweets, get them out of your house. Stay away from your work’s break room during Wednesday snack time (not that I’m speaking from personal experience at CNN).

Know yourself

Rather than asking you to consider your goals, Clear asks you to consider this two-step process.

Decide the type of person you want to be: A healthy person? A strong person? A writer? A musician?

Then prove it to yourself with small wins over time. Gym classes, weight lifting, writing, practicing. Every time you do something toward the goal of you who want to be, tell yourself that you are becoming that person. (I did my Pilates in the morning before I started writing this piece. It’s part of my goal to be a healthy person.)

Make it public

If you’re surrounded by supportive friends and family, making your goals public and asking for accountability can help. So can joining a gym with friendly competition or a group like Weight Watchers.

The resolution guides I spoke to agreed to go public with their resolutions: Norcross resolved to stop multitasking in 2020, and he had already started practicing during our telephone interview. (After he mentioned it, I did feel like I had his full attention.)

Psychologist Lisa Damour, author of “Under Pressure” about the lives of teen girls, plans to focus on meditating in 2020, despite having two children and a more-than-full-time career.

“I’m going to start at five minutes daily,” she said, crediting James Clear with starting a daily “atomic habit” before trying for more.

Rubin is going to try to visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art every day she’s home in Manhattan, a few blocks from the museum.

While that sounds like a tall order, it’s also the subject of her next book — so it’s huge motivation to explore and learn from her new workplace in the new year.

Show (don’t tell) your children

Parents can open the door to a conversation with their children about resolutions by talking about their own reflections and hopes for the new year. They can mention that it’s hard to meet their own goals, and that perfection is not the goal.

Parents can bring up the changes they want to make and model how they want to make those changes, said Damour. It’s important to bring it up without criticizing, she said.

With children under age 10, parents can take the lead in a discussion about where family members have room to grow, she said. Once your children get to adolescence, don’t give them any ideas, she added.

“Parents should work with the assumption that no normally developing teenager wants to be told what to do,” said Damour. If the teenager is quietly doing the right thing and the parent suggests it, kids will likely stop doing it.

“Most of how we guide young people is modeling the behaviors we want,” she said. “If what you say and do don’t match, a teenager will notice and call you on your hypocrisy.”

Change it up

Do you just hate the idea of a resolution for the entire year, seeing an entire year of failure ahead of you? Follow in CNN Features Editor David Allan’s footsteps and set yourself a year of 12 monthly micro-resolutions. In 2018, he eliminated one behavior each month — think alcohol, sweets, screens around his kids, saying the word “like” — and noted the impact of his mood and the effect on himself and his family.

It went so well, this past year he decided to add something to his life every month, including meditation, movement, active listening and more sleep.

Getting enough sleep didn’t go so well for him one month, so he swapped it out. He wrote his own rules, so he could change them and therefore succeed.

65,66,Our view: Curtis Jones to be Liverpool breakthrough star for 2020,"EPL: Wenger speaks on Liverpool going unbeaten, winning title this season","The Reds head into 2020 top of the league and top of the world. With Jürgen Klopp’s men threatening to dominate the coming decade there has never been a better time to be a Kopite. Melwood has been preparing for this coming period of dominance, we believe Curtis Jones will be the breakthrough star of 2020.

Jones has been at Anfield since he was a kid, first turning out for the club at under-nine level. He has rocketed through the ranks at Melwood, impressing at every level, often captaining his side.

The local lad made his first debut in January 2019, starting against Wolves in the FA Cup, he has since collected the man of the match award for his efforts against MK Dons in the League Cup, he scored the winning penalty against Arsenal in the next round.

Jones’ Premier League debut came during the Reds’ 3-0 win over Bournemouth at the start of December. We can expect more first team minutes for him in the near future.

Curtis Jones will surely be our breakthrough star of 2020 as it is the perfect time for him. The Reds have their strongest squad in modern history, there will be plenty of games where we are leading handsomely enough to bring on one of the youngsters.

As long as Jones continues to impress during the cameos we can expect him to win a few starts. The intense footballing style of Klopp’s Liverpool demands rotation, we need to keep our players refreshed in order to maintain our high press – Jones could benefit from this rotation.

Of course, Jones may also benefit from our vast lead at the top of the table, if the Reds were to win the league with time to spare, we may see the gaffer blood some young talent.","Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has disclosed that Liverpool are on course to go unbeaten and win the Premier League title this season.

Liverpool wrapped up their 17th win of the campaign with a 4-0 win over second-placed Leicester City on Boxing Day.

The Reds have only dropped points against Manchester United so far this season.

But Wenger now believes that Jurgen Klopp’s men are on the right track to repeat Arsenal’s ‘Invincibles’ feat of 2003/2004 this term.

Asked whether Liverpool can pull off an ‘Invincibles’ season, Wenger told beIN SPORTS: “They were close last year and they are still on course to do it.

“But I think what Liverpool is expecting at the moment is just to win the Premier League and that is the first target for such a football city.

“To stay for 30 years without winning the Premier League… nobody would have predicted that.

“That is their main target and I think they are on a good run and on a good course to achieving that this season because their main opponent is quite far away already.”

66,67,Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory showcases rare photos of former baseball bat factory employees,Frumpy Middle-aged Mom: My housekeeper is worth more to me than gold,"Hank Aaron, Cal Ripken Jr, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth, Ken Griffey Jr, Derek Jeter. The biggest legends in American baseball history all set records and achieved international fame playing with Louisville Slugger bats, the players’ names immortalized in the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory Hall of Fame in Kentucky.

But what about the men and women who worked in the factories, the artisans and engravers who produced their iconic bats for America’s favorite pastime? What were their names, and what were their stories?

Those are the questions being answered right now in Louisville, Kentucky. As part of the city’s biennial celebration, the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory dug out a trove of old photos, many black and white, from decades and decades of the company’s history. The pictures were a snapshot into not only the company’s past but of post-war American life. But many of the proud faces’ identities were unknown.

Ruby Judd worked at Louisville Slugger for 50 years filling ordered filling orders and doing quality inspection. She was identified by her niece, Laura Quiggins, who said: ‘She was very proud of her job, very proud of the product that they put out'

An unidentified man whittles down a baseball bat. In celebration of Louisville, Kentucky's biennial, the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory is hosting an exhibit that showcases vintage photos of employees that worked in the Hillerich and Bradsby factory over the years. A local campaign asked family, friends and former colleagues to help identify the nameless faces

A local campaign advertised the museum exhibit and showcased the photos in regional media. That’s when friends and colleagues of former workers began collaborating with the effort, and now many of those earnest, nameless faces have been identified.

‘Back in those days, people took such pride in their work,’ says Laura Quiggins, who identified her aunt, Ruby Judd, who was an inspector and order filler more than 50 years ago for Hillerich and Bradsby, the company which began manufacturing Louisville Slugger bats. ‘Nowadays, it’s like people just go to work to get the paycheck – “What’s in it for me?”

‘She was very proud of her job, very proud of the product that they put out,’ Quiggins tells DailyMail.com. ‘It’s so simple, but a little piece of wood made people famous, and those people made the bat famous.’

The effort came about when the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory was asked to participate in the Louisville Biennial, and curator Bailey Mazik thought of the photos she’d seen in archives and desks, folders of workers in the factories, men and women working for a company that began in 1856 and manufactured everything from butter churns to golf clubs to the famous bats – production of which began in 1884. The company receives information about former players on a daily basis, she says – but this was something new and special.

An unidentified employee is seen branding bats. Rena Jenkins, a longtime current employee who began at the company in 1977 instantly recognized a former employee by the name of Georgia Hines. She told DailyMail.com: '...she was a little bitty lady. She probably weighed maybe 110 pounds fully clothed...but she could engrave a bat. Back then, that was her job. She was the only one that did that back then'

‘One of our former vice presidents was kind of an amateur historian himself, so he collected a lot of these and organized these and wrote down a lot of employees’ names,’ Bailey Mazik says of Jack McGrath, who retired in the 80s.

She adds: ‘It has been important for us to know who these people are and to celebrate their hard work.’

One of those people was Quiggins’ Aunt Ruby.

‘She was an inspector and an order-filler,’ Quiggins tells DailyMail.com. ‘She inspected the bats and, when someone placed an order for them, she did the quality assurance … She had worked in several departments, because she was there for years.’

Aunt Ruby, who married and had two children, ‘loved her job,’ Quiggins says.

‘My grandfather worked with wood a lot and made things with wood, and he was a whittler. So she said going into work was like going into Dad’s house. She had built a big long 18-by-12 cedar closet in their house, so their house smelled like cedar – and she said that’s the only smell I don’t smell at work, is cedar. She smelled oak and all the other woods. She said it was a family-oriented place … Everybody knew everybody. She loved working there.

‘That was the place to work, back in the day. It was General Electric, Ford and Hillerich and Bradsby.’

The company has always been based in the Louisville region, and the Kentucky city has become almost synonymous with baseball bats. Tributes to players and their bats are included on a mile-long Walk of Fame through the city, and the Museum is easily identifiable by the world’s largest bat standing proudly outside of it.

Paula Dyer, another woman who identified her aunt and uncle – both Hillerich and Bradsby employees – echoed the sentiments of Ms Quiggins.

Hillerich and Bradsby was the ‘name I grew up with,’ she says. Her Aunt Polly and Uncle John ‘Buck’ Basham started in the 40s and retired in the 70s.

Buck was a WWII Army veteran, and Dyer’s mother and father had worked for Hillerich and Bradsby before leaving, helping her own parents get their jobs.

‘They would get up in the morning ... they were dedicated employees,’ Dyer says of Polly and Buck. They would get up at four in the morning; they would never be a minute late. They never missed a day.’

She adds: They were proud to work there, yes. It was hard work; they never complained too much about it. I remember, Uncle Buck, his hands would be stained.’

The Bashams were so proud, in fact, that they incorporated their company’s product into the cabin they built saving wages, she says.

‘It was a two-story cabin, beautiful cabin, and the stairs – instead of plain old rails on each step, it was a Hillerich and Bradsby baseball bat, she tells DailyMail.com. ‘And you know, none of us have pictures of it and it’s so sad.’

Uncle Buck died in 1976 at the age of 60 – only two years retired – and Aunt Polly passed away in 1999.

‘To be able to recognize them for their hard work and dedication ... I just love it,’ she says.

Rena Jenkins, a longtime current employee who began at the company in 1977 as an 18-year-old on the switchboard, helped identify former workers from the binders of folders such as Georgia Heins.

The effort to name and picture so many people excited her and made her happy to help, she tells DailyMail.com.

‘It is a legacy,’ she says. ‘It goes back so many generations ... I think they realize the history.’

She adds that she still believes the company makes ‘the greatest bat in the world’ and ‘it’s as American as apple pie.’

She’s worked everywhere within the company from accounts payable to shipping and purchasing and in the warehouses and factories, helping her get to know so many employees over the years who were equally proud of their work. One of them was Georgia Heins, who she recognized amongst the pictures.

‘She was real nice; she was a little bitty lady,’ she says. ‘She probably weighed maybe 110 pounds fully clothed and maybe with her pockets lined. She was 5’2, 5’1; she was a small woman, real skinny, but she could engrave a bat. Back then, that was her job. She was the only one that did that back then.'

She tells DailyMail.com that the company has always been ‘like a family.’

‘There was a lot of us that started young, so we were young and inexperienced. We learned off of some of the older ones, and we all started having babies and raising our families, and everybody was always here for everybody else.’

Many of the positions, she admits, ‘were tedious jobs – but they just had a little assembly line, and then you had a lot of husband and wives worked here. And then you had several that met their wives here and married.’

‘Years ago, whenever you had a baby, they used to send us a full-sized personalized bat with a letter from the president [of the company] saying: “Welcome to the Hillerich and Bradsby family.” And they would send us a personalized bat with the day they were born, their height, weight and all of that. So each of my kids have that.’

Archivist Mazik says that emphasis on connectivity and support has ‘been important and implemented in our company for as long as I can tell.

‘We all really make a point to know each other, all different departments, all different kinds of jobs. It has been really special to me to see how employees keep in touch with each other and how they take care of each other.’

The exhibit will run through the end of January, but Mazik hopes it can lead to even further historical research and memorialization of the people responsible for the building blocks of America’s favorite pastime.

‘I want to sit down with some of these folks, do formal oral histories that we can archive,’ she says.

She loved working there'","This is without a doubt my favorite day that rolls around every two weeks, and I’m not talking about payday (though that’s up there pretty high as well.) Today is the day that my housekeeper comes to rescue me from my own sloth, and I never get tired of it, or bored by repetition, even though it occurs every two weeks. (I’m calling her Ronda but that’s not her real name.) Author Erma Bombeck once said that cleaning your house while the kids were still growing is like sweeping your porch while it’s still snowing and I think that’s true, but I still look forward to it.

Here are the happy stages of “Ronda The Housekeeper Day:”

Stage One

Go to the ATM and get some cash, because my kids always suck up any excess I have lying around. I pay Ronda around $20 an hour, which I think is fair for five hours of manual labor cleaning my toilet and mopping my floors. Occasionally, someone will act surprised at this, and insist they can get me someone cheaper. “Gee, I know someone who will clean your whole house for $30!” Well, here’s the thing: I’m not interested in exploiting people just because they’re desperate and will work for less. Ronda came to this country from Guatemala (She’s in this country legally now so don’t send me any hate mail, thank you) as a mom deserted by her abusive, alcoholic husband. She left her boys with her mother and came up here to find a job to support them. At first, she told me, she worked for room and board only, which in my mind sounds an awful lot like slavery. Not the only time I’ve heard that kind of story, by the way. I pay her what I think is fair, and if you bargain your cleaning lady down to get her to scrub your floors for less, I probably wouldn’t like you.

Stage Two

Scurry around and put away anything that I think might get misplaced. Two women putting things away in the same kitchen is never a good thing. I spend a lot of time pacing and thinking, “Dang, where would she have put the measuring cups?” It’s just easier to put them away before she gets here. I usually throw a load of towels in the washer to give her a head start, since she does our linens. Sometimes I’ll wipe up the dog vomit or something else that’s particularly disgusting, though I’m not one of those people who cleans the house before the housekeeper arrives. I’ve always been a little confused by that concept. I know there are a lot of you out there, so please explain it to me.

Stage Three

Greet Ronda when she arrives, then vamoose as quickly as possible. I don’t want to be around while she’s cleaning for two reasons. First, because I can tell I’m getting in her way, though she would never say so. The second and more important reason is that I feel guilty. I feel vaguely ashamed that I’m making someone else clean the gunk out of my bathroom sink, even though I know she wants and needs the work.

Best-selling author Barbara Ehrenreich wrote a piece for Harper’s magazine back in 2000 called “Maid to Order: The politics of other women’s work” that I could never get completely out of my head. She went to work as a employee of one of those corporate housekeeping companies for the experience, so she could write about it from an informed perspective.

She wrote that people like to hire cleaning services, because they needn’t have a relationship with one person and watch her scrub their bathtub. Seriously, do you really think those maids are merry? Because I’m pretty sure they’re not. Some people also worry about theft, though I’ve never had a problem. One of my former housekeepers, who fled the death squads in El Salvador, had been a college professor there, and the only problem I had with her was letting her finish her work, because she was so interesting I always just wanted to talk. My mother was a neat freak who grew up an orphan in Texas, where in those days the difference between “white trash” and respectable folk was how clean they kept their houses. My mom could never abide the fact that her daughter was clearly trash.

Stage Four

Come home to a sparkling, lemon-scented house with freshly folded towels and clean sheets, enjoying an hour of pure bliss after walking through the door. At this point, I might think about how I really can’t afford a housekeeper, and wonder which kid I should get rid of so I can continue to hire her services.

Stage Five

It’s been 24 hours since Ronda was here, and I’m wondering how my house could possibly look so trashed. I also wonder why my son needs five towels for one shower and why he can’t pick them up off the floor. There’s nothing to be done but pine for her next visit.

Washington (AFP) - Illinois started the new year on a high note Wednesday, becoming the latest US state to legalize recreational marijuana as the governor pardoned thousands for past low-level cannabis convictions.

The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act will allow residents 21 and older to legally purchase marijuana and will expunge thousands of individuals' criminal convictions throughout the state.

""We are restoring rights to many tens of thousands of Illinoisans. We are bringing regulation and safety to a previously unsafe and illegal market. And we are creating a new industry that puts equity at its very core,"" Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker said in a statement.

On Tuesday night, Pritzker granted 11,017 pardons for people with low-level cannabis convictions, the first round of a planned total of more than 700,000.

According to the statement, the new law will use 25 percent of the state's cannabis revenue to help ""the communities hit hardest"" by the earlier crackdown on marijuana.

""Today we took another step toward justice, as we continue to address the failed war on drugs and the disproportionate impact it had on communities of color,"" Cook County State Attorney Kim Foxx said in the statement.

Illinois residents age 21 and older will now be allowed to legally possess 30 grams of cannabis, five grams of cannabis concentrate or 500 milligrams of THC -- the main active ingredient of cannabis -- contained in a cannabis-infused product.

Non-residents are allowed to carry 15 grams of cannabis under the bill, which will also create a licensed growing and dispensary system.

Illinois is the 11th state to legalize recreational marijuana, along with Washington, DC. Thirty-four states and the federal capital permit medical cannabis treatment.

But the US Drug Enforcement Administration still considers marijuana a dangerous substance alongside LSD and heroin.

A study by the federal Centers for Disease Control published in August found that states that legalize recreational marijuana see a reduction of at least 20 percent in fatalities linked to opioid overdoses.

Marijuana legalization has also been shown to improve a state's economic activity, creating jobs and bringing in new tax revenue.","Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker granted more than 11,000 pardons for low-level marijuana convictions Tuesday — one day before a sweeping law makes cannabis legal in the state for people 21 and older.

The 11,017 pardons are a small part of the law Pritzker signed in June, making Illinois the 11th state in the nation to legalize weed use by adults. The law is also intended to help people held back from jobs, housing and financial aid for college because of drug convictions, according to state officials.

“We are ending the 50-year long war on cannabis,” the Democratic governor, who made the announcement at a church on Chicago’s South Side, said in a statement.

“We are restoring rights to many tens of thousands of Illinoisans. We are bringing regulation and safety to a previously unsafe and illegal market. And we are creating a new industry that puts equity at its very core.”

State officials said about 116,000 convictions for possession of 30 grams or less of marijuana — not associated with a violent crime — are eligible for pardons under the new law.

In all, the law could offer relief to the more than 700,000 residents with marijuana-related offenses on their criminal records, according to state officials and the Marijuana Policy Project.

The state’s new Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, which takes effect Wednesday, allows people to automatically receive clemency for convictions up to 30 grams of cannabis. Those convicted with larger amounts, from 30 to 500 grams, can petition a court to have the charge lifted.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois, in a statement Tuesday, applauded the governor for “acting to address the history of unnecessary and discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws in Illinois.”

“The governor’s pardons of Illinoisans with convictions for marijuana possession makes the new year brighter for thousands,” said Ben Ruddell, criminal justice policy director for the ACLU of Illinois.

“We know that black Illinois residents are far more likely to be arrested and convicted for marijuana possession than whites. This is a good step forward as we begin the legal sales of recreational marijuana.”

The law defines “expunge” to mean to “physically destroy the records or return them to the petitioner and to obliterate the petitioner’s name from any official index or public record, or both.” But it doesn’t require the physical destruction of circuit court files.

“The 11,017 pardons that Gov. Pritzker is granting today are thousands of lives forever changed — and hundreds of thousands more will be changed in the coming months,” Toi Hutchinson, senior adviser to the governor for cannabis control, said in a statement.

“Those who were unfairly targeted by discriminatory drug laws can finally get ahead and build a new future for themselves and their families.”

So far 18 states have decriminalized marijuana, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. In all, 34 states allow patients with health complaints to use medical marijuana.

Illinois is the latest state to offer clemency for marijuana convictions. In May, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed a law that gave marijuana offenders the ability to have their sentences vacated in the state.",1.0,2.0,1.5,1.5,2.0,1.0,1.5," Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act will allow residents 21 and older to legally purchase marijuana .

During the first week of December, notorious Ukrainian Nazis supported the West's color revolution destruction in Hong Kong. No CIA-NGO attempt to overthrow anti-imperialist countries around the world is complete, without a few Nazis to lend an evil hand (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/11/16/china-bolivia-and-venezuela-are-proof-that-social-democracy-cannot-thrive-in-the-global-capitalist-system-china-rising-radio-sinoland-191116/).

Ihor Maliar, Serhii Sternenko and Serhii Filimonov are well known members of the Ukrainian Nazi groups, Azov Battalion and Right Sektor. They wear swastikas, iron crosses and other Nazi symbols, including their ubiquitous tattoos, as caught on camera in Hong Kong above. Both of these two fascist groups are funded by the US National Endowment for Democracy (NED) and other CIA front NGOs (https://sputniknews.com/asia/201912021077466396-why-are-ukrainian-neo-nazis-joining-the-hong-kong-protests/).

This is a particularly revolting affront to the Chinese people, of whom 25-35 million died during World War II, in helping to defeat global fascism. Given this 20th century history, these Ukie goons were surely sent to Hong Kong to get a reaction out of Baba Beijing, which will not happen (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/11/28/hong-kong-ensnared-in-the-wests-color-revolution-hot-box-the-latest-news-and-analysis-china-rising-radio-sinoland-191128/). These Nazis also created a color revolution Facebook group in Ukraine, called Free Hong Kong Center, as shown below. Sieg Heils, Herr CIA!

We can safely say that the CIA-NGO complex has connected their Hong Kong terrorists to Ukrainian Nazis to work together. I can't think of two groups that deserve each other more.

The Taiwan-HK color revolution nexus is no less obvious. Taiwanese ""tourists"" have been caught at the Hong Kong Airport, with suitcases full of masks, helmets and other terrorist weapons (https://youtu.be/10HaTxCrklU). Taiwan is offering sanctuary and support to Hong Kong subversives (https://www.presstv.com/Detail/2019/07/19/601315/Taiwan-Hong-Kong-protests-sanctuary). Treasonous leaders, like Joshua Wong, have flown to Taiwan, seeking help to destroy HK (http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aCS/201909030007.aspx).

Taiwan is part of a continuous nexus of anti-socialist-communist China color revolutions going back to Tiananmen Square in 1989 (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/05/30/over-100000-people-around-the-world-have-read-this-you-should-too-china-rising-radio-sinoland-190604/).

During March 2014, in precision organized scenes eerily similar to Hong Kong's, and right on the heels of the bloody, US orchestrated overthrow of the pro-Russian government in Ukraine (Maidan), students stormed the Taiwanese legislature, occupying it to protest a proposed law to increase commerce with the Mainland. It became known as the Sunflower Movement and had all the hallmarks of a Western organized and financed color revolution. It so shook Taiwan and was such a huge loss of face for the pro-Beijing KMT Party, that it heavily lost later local and national elections, putting into power the US backed/manipulated, secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Since then, cross-strait relations have gone from positive and productive to sour and confrontational. Chalk up a temporary and futile victory for Western imperialism.

Flash forward five years. When the Hong Kong color revolution terrorists stormed their legislature, they ransacked it, costing millions of dollars in damage, needing months of repairs. Not by coincidence, they painted in big Chinese-character graffiti,

Chinese President Xi Jinping is going to Macau this week, to join the 20th anniversary celebrations for the territory's return to the Motherland, after 450 years of Portuguese control (https://macaunews.mo/president-xi-jinping-to-arrive-on-december-18-government-sources-say/). He's staying three days, which is unprecedented and a statement in itself. Macau's history is much different than that of colonial Hong Kong, and you can feel the striking differences by visiting both. Mrs. Graça Pacheco Jorge did a great job of explaining this, in her written interview on China Rising Radio Sinoland. It is well worth reading (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/05/22/graca-pacheco-jorge-magical-and-mysterious-macau-the-anti-hong-kong-china-rising-radio-sinoland-190522/). She explains why Macau's reintegration into the Mainland China has been seamlessly successful.

During Xi's visit, it is expected that the development of a Macau stock market will be officially approved (https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1497360-20191212.htm). They even sold a Macau bond this week, worth US$730 million, to make another statement (https://www.chinanews.com/ga/2019/12-13/9033268.shtml). While not big by world standards, the message is clear. This is a direct result and an oblique riposte to the West's ongoing color revolution destruction of next-door Hong Kong (HK), something I have reported on extensively, since it began in 2014. This article/podcast gives a nice 10-point recap of the horrific events taking place there (https://chinarising.puntopress.com/2019/11/28/hong-kong-ensnared-in-the-wests-color-revolution-hot-box-the-latest-news-and-analysis-china-rising-radio-sinoland-191128/). Hong Kong is still a British colony in all but name.

Pictured above: I think the Macanese are trying to give Xi Jinping a hint. Here they are with a mock stock market board and Wall-Street-esque gong, to welcome their first bond sold.

This is part of much bigger picture concerning Hong Kong's precarity. For years, Baba Beijing has been holding Shenzhen's and Guangzhou's airports back, so as to not hurt Hong Kong's economy, which is critically dependent on short-stay tourists. Every year, 60 million visitors pass through for a few days of eating, shopping and sightseeing. China has let Hong Kong keep air tickets cheap, relative to nearby mainland Shenzhen and Guangzhou, not to mention letting HK have many more and frequent regional and international destinations. Ticket prices and destinations are currently so competitive in Hong Kong, that huge numbers of people in Shenzhen and Guangzhou take the high-speed train and ferry there, to then fly around the world. My wife and I did it all the time, when we lived in Shenzhen for three years. Like all these millions of transiting Mainlanders, we would often stay 1-2 days coming and/or going, spending our money in the local economy.

If Baba Beijing gives the go-ahead to China's airlines to compete with Hong Kong out of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, it would cripple Hong Kong's economy. That hasn't happened yet, but clearly China giving Macau the green light to open a NASDAQ-style stock market is a harbinger to Western color revolution destroyed HK, since the latter has historical bragging rights as Asia's ""Wall Street"". Baba Beijing has been keeping Macau's stock market dreams on the back burner for 20 years.

69,70,Everybody is focused on the political arena of entertainment while the framework for a medical tyranny is being built behind the scenes. They’re trying to claim ownership of your body under the guise ,New FDA labels include nutrition info for eating that whole pint of ice cream,"by January2020

“Was the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now”.

~Thomas Jefferson

Everybody is focused on the political arena of entertainment while the framework for a medical tyranny is being built behind the scenes.

Conspiracy and corruption in our medical industry is one of the most stealthy forms of control. Average people just assume that the medical community has our best interests in mind so they don’t scrutinize the information coming from that direction to the same degree.

The white lab coat has been offered as a symbol of unbiased purity. FFS, think about how Monsanto used to be given a wide pass merely because SciEnTiStS dOn’T liE tO uS, aNd MoNsAnTo = sCiEnCe!

Thankfully people are starting to wise up to the whole Monsanto/Bayer debacle and have realized that Monsanto was successfully pulling off unfactual Tobacco $cience for decades. Big victory for humanity!

The problem is, they’re still ignoring a huge fucking elephant in the corner.

The medical system in the USA kills approximately 225,000 people every year. About 106,000 of those people died from drugs they were prescribed.

Did you catch that? About 106,000 people die every year due to following the instructions of their doctor and taking the drugs prescribed to them as directed.

Jon Rappoport points out that the medical community supports and is supported by both sides of the political spectrum and enjoys a type of invisibilty and freedom from scrutiny due to this percieved neutrality. They aren’t “neutral”, though. Their polararity slide can be labeled Government Granted Power vs. The Best Interests of the Populace. They have polarized in one major direction: suckling the teats of government and consolidating power while ignoring the best interests of the populace.

Which is Worse: The NSA or The FDA?

December 30, 2019

By Jon Rappoport

A message to WikiLeaks, Cryptome, Public Intelligence, and other sites that expose secrets.

Does 2.25 million deaths in America, per decade, at the hands of the medical system, rate as a significant leak?

As my readers know, I’ve reported on a number of scandals concerning the toxicity of medical drugs, including shocking death numbers in the US.

These scandals are leaks from inside the National Security State.

If you visit WikiLeaks, Cryptome, Public Intelligence, and other similar sites, how many purely medical documents do you find posted?

How many damaging leaks exposing the crimes of the medical cartel do you find?

Very, very few.

Where are the medical insiders who are liberating and passing along incriminating documentary evidence?

Some of the best exposers of political, intelligence-agency, and military crimes are way behind the curve, when it comes to medical matters.

The medical sphere, for various reasons, is far better protected than any other segment of society.

For the hundredth time, let me cite Dr. Barbara Starfield’s stunning review, “Is US health really the best in the world?” published on July 26, 2000, in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Starfield, at the time, was working as a highly respected public health expert, at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.

She concluded that the US medical system kills 225,000 Americans a year. That would add up to 2.25 million deaths per decade.

Laid directly at the door of the American medical complex.

106,000 of those annual deaths, as Starfield reports, are the direct result of medical drugs.

Aside from the genocidal death toll, Starfield’s findings also imply massive fraud in all medical journals that routinely publish glowing results of clinical trials of drugs.

Such trials open the door to the marketing of drugs that kill, according to Starfield, 106,000 Americans every year. How is this possible unless deep, continuing, and abetted research fraud are the order of the day?

Indeed, Dr. Marcia Angell, the editor of New England Journal of Medicine for 20 years, wrote the following:

“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.” (NY Review of Books, January 15, 2009)

The FDA, of course, is the single government agency responsible for certifying drugs as safe and effective, before their public release is permitted. Yet the FDA takes absolutely no responsibility for the deaths.

Can you imagine the feeding frenzy, if, say, some leaker in the Pentagon passed along a political/military document to Wikileaks that showed the Dept. of Defense was poisoning to death, like clockwork, a hundred thousand of its own soldiers every year?

Let’s stop this insane nonsense of separating one whole set of government crimes from another, simply because the propagandized priests in the white coats are above reproach.

We’re not living in 1950 anymore, and this isn’t Kansas.

In 1988, when I was writing my first book, AIDS INC., I stated that medical covert ops are the most successful methods for pacifying, debilitating, and controlling populations, through toxification, because these ops fly the flag of political neutrality.

They appear to favor no king, dictator, president, government administration or partisan position.

Their propaganda is all about healing and helping.

In fact, the medical cartel is, in the long run, the most effective branch of political repression, from one end of the planet to the other.

It favors top-down control by those in power, whoever they are, whatever they claim to stand for.

Consider this: when Ed Snowden released NSA documents that showed the extent of government surveillance on populations, no one from the intelligence establishment made a serious case that Snowden’s revelations were false. Instead, they attacked Snowden for exposing “methods” of “the war on terror.”

However, in the medical arena, leakers would be afraid that doctors, medical bureaucrats, public health agencies, government leaders, drug-company fronts, and major media outlets would, all at once, deny the validity and truth of the leaks—despite the fact that the truth is there for all to see.

In other words, the best protected cartel in the world—medical—would act in a far more Orwellian fashion. It would say: the truth is not the truth, the facts are not the facts, 2 and 2 do not equal 4—and the cartel would get away with doing that.

This is the kind of clout we’re talking about when it comes to medical matters.

Over the years, I’ve alerted mainstream reporters to the Starfield review, cited above, and other confirming published studies that reveal the horrific extent of medical destruction. Those reporters who bothered to get back to me issued blanket denials. They essentially said, “Yes, I see the evidence and the facts, but the facts aren’t facts. What’s happening isn’t happening.”

Now we’re talking about some heavy brainwashing.

By comparison, it makes the quality of the scandal around Snowden seem like a Sunday lunch in the park.

A few years ago, I had one reporter, who exposes political leaks, tell me: “I don’t mess with medical stuff. It would ruin my credibility.”

Indeed. Another indication of how powerful the medical apparatus is.

Recently, the Washington Post highlighted a new study that puts “medical errors” as the 3rd leading cause of death in America. There hasn’t been any significant follow-up. There hasn’t been an explosion of outrage. So even when exposure occurs, the brainwashing factor is so strong it makes no difference. It’s just another ho-hum day in the news business.

That’s mind control par excellence. That’s tremendous protection of criminals.

That’s like a crime boss saying, “Yeah, I kill 225,000 people every year, but it’s an accident”—and nothing happens.

He goes his merry way, and everyone praises him as a humanitarian.

Talk about inventing and selling false reality.

This one is at the top of the charts, and it stays there.

I could stop here, but I’m going to take this one step further, because, as you can see, I’m talking about mind control. So here is the vital add-on:

American Natural Superfood – Free Sample

From the dawn of history, humans have been particularly vulnerable to statements, from “selfless altruists,” about being saved, being rescued, being given gifts from above. And behind those statements, when there is an organization involved, a top-down organization, the threat level rises considerably.

Leaders have always recognized that if they match their pronouncements and assurances with the population’s unflagging hope of being saved, they, the leaders, win. They win big.

Even in societies where overt human sacrifice was practiced, the cover story involved some kind of healing and rescue. The good gods would see the sacrifices and intervene to produce “better days.” Better life for all.

This is what was sold, and this was what was bought. For many people, the times have not changed. Make them a promise of medical rescue, and they’re in. They’re floating in a hopeful trance.

A hypnotic induction has been performed, and it works.

The controlled subject responds with gratitude.

At that point, you can engage in complete contradictions, rank absurdities, and doublespeak.

The trance will hold.

As my old research collaborator, hypnotherapist Jack True, once told me in an interview, “People want dreams. When they lose faith in their own ability to dream about the life they want, they’ll accept someone else dreaming for them. That’s what hypnosis is. Someone else dreaming for you. You accept a substitute. That’s mind control. That’s believing you can live in someone else’s creation forever…”

If I were the head of an institution of higher learning, I would engrave that quote above the gates, and I would build a four-year course that explores the implications of the quote in every dimension of human existence.

The medical cartel is the best-protected organization on the planet.

Disclaimer: This content does not necessarily represent the views of IWB.","ABC News(NEW YORK) — On Jan. 1, the Food and Drug Administration’s new nutrition labeling rules kick in, ushering in a host of changes to the way that manufacturers are required to label packaged foods.

Perhaps most notably, new guidelines require two side-by-side columns: one with nutritional information for a single serving, and a second with information for eating the entire package.

Manufacturers that yield less than $10 million in annual food sales will have until 2021 to comply with the new rules.

“We know that Americans are eating differently, and the amount of calories and nutrients on the label is required to reflect what people actually eat and drink,” Claudine Kavanaugh, director of nutrition and food labeling in the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said in a statement.

While consumers might not notice a huge change at first glance, Beth Kitchin, an assistant professor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s department of nutrition sciences, appreciated the enlarged and emboldened calorie information on the new labels, as well as the new emphasis on serving size.

Serving sizes are based on Americans’ eating habits, determined by the amount people said they consumed in federal food surveys over the past few decades.

With foods that can reasonably be consumed in one sitting, like a pint of ice cream, “the serving size is not what you think it is,” Kitchin said. “It’s a really good change because so many times I’ve talked with consumers who were deceived by that.”

Dr. Frank Hu, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, called the new label changes an “important step forward.”

He pointed to the fact that manufacturers are now required to disclose added sugars on labels.

“Because higher added sugar intake has been associated with a wide range of adverse health consequences, it is important to distinguish added sugars from natural sugars in a product,” Hu said.

Consuming too much added sugar has been linked to weight gain, obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Differentiating between naturally occurring and added sugar could also clear up confusion among Americans who think that all sugar is bad for them.

Kitchin said that Americans who are trying to lower their sugar intake sometimes eschew foods like milk, which has naturally occurring sugar, and miss out on nutrients along the way.

“In people’s overexuberance to decrease sugars, they may be decreasing some healthy foods,” she said.

In general, Kitchin hopes the changes will encourage customers to take more interest in reading nutrition labels and prompt them to compare foods’ nutritional information before they buy.

“Hopefully, the information on the new label will not only help consumers make more informed decisions about their food and beverage choices, but also motivate food manufacturers to improve nutritional quality of their products,” Hu added.

The North Korean supreme leader on Thursday expressed his intentions to continue developing new strategic weapons for his nuclear arsenal, according to the country's state media. Hours later, Trump responded by boasting about his relationship with Kim, saying ""he likes me, I like him, we get along.""

""He's representing his country, I'm representing my country, we have to do what we have to do,"" the president added. ""I think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out, but I think he's a man of this word.""

After Trump dismissed Kim's threats of more weapons of war, Wendy Sherman—who served as Counselor of the U.S. Department of State, Special Advisor to the President and North Korea Policy Coordinator under the Clinton administration—condemned the president's latest efforts in foreign policy.

""I think what is different here is that Kim Jong Un has played the president like a Stradivarius violin,"" she told MSNBC host Frances Rivera Wednesday. ""He has used the time and the photo-ops to gain credibility internationally, while at the same time gaining time to continue to develop his weapons and indeed probably does have a new strategic weapon, at least on its way to reality.""

Sherman, who's currently a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, then explained the two most important takeaways from Kim's remarks and the ongoing stalemate over denuclearization.

""One, Kim Jong Un is signaling that he's still open to diplomacy, though what his objectives are is to reduce the sanctions or get rid of them entirely, the president's objective is denuclearization,"" she said.

""Secondly, Kim Jong Un is watching what's happening in the rest of the world with China, in Iraq, with Iran and all of that says to him that the president of the United States is in a much weaker position.""

Kim's announcement of potentially expanding his weapons arsenal comes less than two months after Defense Secretary Mark Esper confirmed the U.S. postponement of a joint military exercise with South Korea as an ""act of goodwill"" to help end nuclear deadlock with North Korea. Esper made the announcement alongside his South Korean counterpart, Jeong Kyeong-doo, in November, despite warnings from Japan that Kim is unlikely to reciprocate such a gesture.","USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump played down rhetorical attacks from Kim Jong Un as the end-of-the-year holidays passed Wednesday without any new nuclear tests in North Korea – but with threats of future ones.

""If the U.S. persists in its hostile policy toward the DPRK (North Korea), there will never be the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula,"" the Korean Central News Agency said, quoting Kim as he announced he no longer feels bound by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear testing.

Trump, speaking with reporters at his annual New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, said he still has ""a very good relationship"" with Kim, with whom he has met three times.

""He likes me, I like him, we get along,"" Trump said, adding: ""He did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization. ... I think he's a man of his word, so we're going to find out.""

In announcing that his moratorium on nuclear testing is no longer operative, Kim also told a meeting of ruling party officials in North Korea he would unveil a ""new strategic weapon"" in the near future, the state news agency said. Kim had given the United States an end-of-the-year deadline to reduce economic sanctions on his country or face the prospect of new nuclear tests.

""The DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy,"" the Korean Central News Agency reported Kim as saying.

Trump administration officials had feared such a test during the holiday – a North Korea official had threatened a ""Christmas gift"" to the U.S. – but nothing had happened as midnight passed in North Korea.

In speaking with reporters, Trump joked that he hoped Kim's ""Christmas present"" was ""a beautiful vase ... as opposed to something else.""

Trump remains hopeful of a denuclearization agreement with North Korea, though critics say Kim's government has continued to develop nuclear programs even after the two leaders signed a document at their first summit in June of 2018. The two men also met in 2019 in Vietnam and at the North Korea-South Korea border.

Since its introduction 47 years ago, the Metro Parks Winter Hike Series has morphed into a massive event.

Thousands of people now show up for the hikes which take place in January and February at 13 of the system’s 19 parks. Participants are treated to guided and self-guided hikes, hot chocolate and soup, and the fellowship of like-minded winter adventurers.

But with all that good stuff comes lots of discarded bowls, spoon and cups, and carbon emissions from cars carrying those adventurers to and from the parks.

While Metro Parks is thrilled that so many people have latched onto the hike series, they also want to be good stewards of the environment.

“We’re happy to provide the experience, but we also don’t want to make a mess of this world,” said Jill Snyder, assistant manager of education and interpretation.

To that end, Metro Parks started a few years ago to encourage participants to carpool to the hikes and bring their own reusable mugs and bowls. Hikers also can earn commemorative mugs by donating five cans of food, five personal hygeine items, or $5 to the Mid Ohio Food Bank.

This year, the park system is ramping up its conservation efforts even more.

“We’re really trying to reduce waste from the event,” Snyder said.

To do that, Metro Parks is using compostable bowls and utensils where possible in place of styrofoam and plastic. They have partnered with The Compost Exchange, which will compost refuse and food waste from the hikes, as well as educate hikers about composting. In addition to the mugs hikers can earn with food bank donations, the Friends of the Metro Parks are selling reusable bowls and spoons.

“We hope to divert a whole lot of trash from the landfill,” Snyder said.

Metro Parks staffers plan to track just how much waste they divert.

“If we hit certain goals, we’re going to save the turtles–not sea turtles, but our own Ohio turtles,” Snyder said.

The idea is to provide better habitat and resources for protection of turtles, especially box turtles, whose numbers are declining due to habitat loss and fragmentation. (Turtles are getting hit on roads, including those within the parks, that bisect their living areas.) Additionally, a new nature center planned for Blacklick Woods Metro Park in Reynoldsburg will include an educational component on turtles.

So, what do turtles have to do with waste reduction?

“Sometimes, it’s hard to get people excited about trash… This way, we’re saying that if we can get everyone on board with our conservation efforts, we as a Metro Park district will give back to protecting the environment,” Snyder said.

This year’s motto for the Winter Hike Series is “Hike to a Greener Place.” For more information, go to metroparks.net.

Firefighters responded to Maquan Pond in Hanson after receiving a report of people yelling near the water shortly after 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to Hanson Fire Chief Jerome Thompson.

The men were about 100 yards offshore, holding on to the capsized boat, Thompson said. Firefighters in survival suits used an ice rescue sled to pull the men ashore. Both men were taken to a local hospital to be treated for exposure.

Thompson said it was a difficult rescue because of the combination of ice and open water.

The Catalan giants have confirmed that an agreement has been reached with Real Betis for the loan of young midfielder Carles Alena.

The Spaniard has found game time hard to come by this season and will now be able to get regular LaLiga top flight game time with Betis.

A statment from Barca's website read

FC Barcelona and Real Betis have reached an agreement for the loan transfer of Carles Aleñá until the end of the season. Real Betis will take over the player's registration, but the agreement doesn't include any purchase option.

The likes of Arturo Vidal and Ivan Rakitic have also been linked with departures in the upcoming January transfer window.

Do you think Barcelona need to sign any players next month? Have your say in the comment section below.","Barcelona have reportedly decided not to sell Arturo Vidal to Inter Milan in the January transfer window despite interest from the Serie A leaders.

The Catalan giants have decided against allowing the Chile international to move because they have already loaned Carles Alena to Real Betis and have Arthur out injured.

Cadena Cope report that despite Vidal’s complaint about unpaid bonuses and frustration at not being at starter the club want to keep him for the rest of the season.

Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti has made his club’s interest in Vidal pretty clear in the last few days saying he is a “player with great character and experience, so we’ll see what happens.”

However, Barca confirmed that Alena would spent the rest of the season on loan at Betis earlier in the week and also announced Arthur is out for another three weeks.

The Brazilian has not featured for Barcelona since the win over Atletico Madrid at the start of the month, and there seems to be some concern about when he will be back to his best.

Thousands of customers who bank with Halifax, Lloyds, and RBS customers are experiencing problems with online banking on the first day of the new year.

Online banking is down for all three banks across large parts of the UK as the websites have crashed.

Halifax and Lloyds has apologised for the ""issues"" and a spokesman says they are working on resolving them as a priority.

In a statement both said: ""We know our customers are having issues with internet and mobile banking.

""We're sorry about this and we're working to have it back to normal soon.""

RBS has not yet released a statement.

Lloyds said they are working on the problem but ""if you urgently need to transfer funds you can call our phone bank team on 0345 300 0000 and they would be able to look at it for you"".

One customer said: ""Obviously the millennium bug overslept by 20 years."" Another added: ""Lloyds taking the 'bank holiday' a little too literally.""","The new year has got off to a bad start for millions of Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland customers, who have been unable to gain access to their accounts through the websites and mobile apps because of an outage.

The three brands, which are part of Lloyds Banking Group, put out the same statement on Twitter on Wednesday morning after the problem started at about 4am. “We know our customers are having issues with internet and mobile banking. We’re sorry about this and we’re working to have it back to normal soon.”

Lloyds said its IT team had identified the problem and had fixed it. The problem only affected the login but it said online and mobile banking was now 75% back to normal and would be fully back within the next 20 minutes. The company said telephone banking and ATM transactions had not been affected by the problem.

A spokeswoman was unable to say whether customers would get any compensation but added that anyone who had incurred charges as a result of the outage should get in touch with the bank.

76,77,State-of-art Istanbul Airport to display aviation hub potential in 2020,"Turkish Airlines expands fleet, opens 4 new routes in 2020","Heading into 2020, the huge state-of-art Istanbul Airport, which is currently only partially open and still under development, will for the first time be fully operational for a full year in 2020. It will, therefore, have a chance to showcase its full potential by hosting 90 million passengers, a figure it can handle in the initial phase of development.



Already seen as the new center of aviation rising from the outskirts of Turkey's most populous city, perched firmly on the shores of the Black Sea, the airport was officially opened in a grand ceremony on Oct. 29, 2018, coinciding with the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. Two days later, Turkish Airlines flight TK214 took off for the capital Ankara as the first aircraft to leave the airport.



However, its first phase became fully operational on April 7, as it took over the air traffic from the now-closed Atatürk Airport. The civil aviation adventure undertaken at Atatürk Airport, which was commissioned in 1953, said goodbye with the pride of having accomplished its mission successfully. It was one of the busiest airports in Europe. The airport has transitioned to other uses such as training activities, aviation fairs and civil use, while some parts are to be transformed into a public park.



GREATEST LOGISTIC OPERATION



The transfer from Atatürk Airport was a success story in its own right. In what was said to be the greatest logistic operation in civil aviation history, thousands of tons of equipment, from huge aircraft-towing vehicles to extremely sensitive materials, were ferried across the city. Trucks carried equipment a total distance of 400,000 kilometers, an equivalent of going 10 times around the world. Over 1,800 personnel were employed during the operation.



Scheduled to last 45 hours, the operation was completed in a record time of 33 hours. It began in the early hours of April 5, 2019, and was completed on April 6, 2019, in the afternoon.



The airport – a pinpoint megaproject by the ruling Justice and Development Party (AK Party) – was initially launched over a need for meeting the ever-growing demand from around the world, relieving air traffic with a strong infrastructure and large capacity.



Completed in 42 months, the first phase of the airport was built with a cost of 6 billion euros ($6.72 billion) with a public-private partnership (PPP) model by a consortium of Turkey's leading contractors Limak, Kolin, Cengiz, Mapa and Kalyon. The consortium will pay 1.1 billion euros annually for 25 years. The project represents a total economic size of 32.4 billion euros, excluding taxes. This figure constitutes an investment cost of 10.2 billion euros and 22.2 billion euros for rental costs to be paid to the government.



Before its establishment, there were two airports in one of the world's most crowded cities, Sabiha Gökçen Airport on Istanbul's Anatolian side and Atatürk Airport on the European side. Atatürk Airport served some 68 million passengers in 2018, its last year, while Sabiha Gökçen has a current capacity to welcome some 31 million passengers a year.



The new airport can handle 90 million passengers a year in the current phase of development, which, while it is a high figure, is nothing compared to its potential capacity to serve 200 million after the completion of all phases.



It served some 40.47 million passengers in its first year, while it reached its 50 millionth passenger on Dec. 23.



Once fully operational, it will be the world's largest in terms of the number of passengers. All four phases of the airport's construction and expansion, including six runways, are expected to be completed by 2028.



Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Cahit Turhan in October said the construction of the third parallel runway at the airport in the area of 76.5 million square meters located on the coast of the Black Sea between Yeniköy and Akpınar regions was nearing an end.



He said the runway is expected to be put into service in the summer of 2020 and with the opening of the runway, the Triple Parallel Runway Operation used in just a few airports in the world will be implemented.



An east-west runway and a parallel taxiway will also be built in the second stage. The second terminal building of approximately 450,000 square meters will be put into service when the number of passengers reaches 80 million and an additional parallel runway with parallel taxiways and an additional apron are said to be used in this process.



When the number of passengers reaches 110 million, a new satellite terminal of 170,000 square meters is planned to be put into service at the end of the fourth stage.



The airport will eventually be able to host more than 100 airlines and operate 3,500 flights per day to about 350 destinations worldwide, making the city an aviation hub that has already seen an increasing demand thanks to its strategic location and as being a center for connecting flights.



ENVIRONMENT-FRIENDLY AVIATION CENTER



The Istanbul Airport project is not only drawing attention as a travel hub. It also contains and uses state-of-the-art technology and has earned a reputation for its environmental awareness policies in line with international standards.



The airport's terminal building, which has continued to improve its sustainability since the design phase, was built to provide 24% more energy efficiency and 40% more water efficiency than conventional systems. Moreover, within the ""Climate Change Adaptation and Action Plan,"" the airport has been adapted to climate change.



One policy implemented in the airport to create an environmentally friendly workplace for operators and businesses is the waste sorting system. This policy was part of the Zero Waste Declaration signed by the CEOs of 18 main stakeholders under the leadership of the airport's operator IGA. Accordingly, the waste is divided into five categories, paper/cardboard, packaging, glass, organic and domestic waste, allowing for proper recycling.



A GLOBAL HUB BETWEEN ASIA, AFRICA AND EUROPE



Istanbul Airport has already won several international awards, including the International Airport Reviews' (IAR) ""Readers' Choice: Airport of the Year"" award. The editor of the U.K.-based magazine, Tara Nolan, pointed out that the new airport in Istanbul serves ""as a global hub between Asia, Africa and Europe.""



The award was given to Istanbul Airport from among several other popular international airports, including London Heathrow Airport, Singapore Changi Airport, Copenhagen Airport, Canada's Vancouver Airport, Australia's Sydney Airport and Hong Kong International Airport.



The airport was also awarded during the Dec. 16-18, 2016 World Architecture Festival held in Berlin for the design of its terminal building under the category of ""Upcoming Projects- Infrastructure."" The terminal building is the world's largest terminal building with a single roof.



The flight control tower of the newly inaugurated airport was also awarded by Chicago Athenaeum with the 2016 International Architecture Award.","In 2020, Turkish Airlines will expand and update its fleet, opening four new flight paths, according to the chairman of Turkey's flag carrier.



""We have completed all the necessary procedures to launch flights to Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, Tokyo's Haneda Airport, Newark, New Jersey, and Vancouver, Canada in 2019,"" said İlker Aycı, adding that now they are just waiting for the required permits. Besides the latest batch of new destinations, he said the airline would also focus on frequency depth.

After launching services to 10 new international routes in 2019, the carrier closed the year with a flight network including 318 cities across 126 countries, Aycı noted.

Recalling the airlines' switch from Atatürk Airport to Istanbul's new mega-airport as the company's biggest move in 2019, Aycı said: ""Turkish Airlines has to have a strong infrastructure, one supporting its growth, in order to achieve its goals without interruption.""

Istanbul Airport, the ""World's New Hub,"" officially opened on Oct. 29, 2018, the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Turkish Republic. With the capacity to serve some 200 million passengers per year and with all four phases and six runways to be completed by 2028, Istanbul Airport is set to become a global aviation hub home to more than 100 airlines flying to over 300 destinations around the world.

Underlining that the airline had reached full capacity shortly after moving to the mega-airport, Aycı said: ""Our new home knocked both ourselves and our customers out of the usual routine, but here we learned to walk again, putting aside all our old assumptions.""

While Atatürk Airport fell short of responding to Turkish Airlines' need for more slots and capacity due to constraints such as runway insufficiency, the company now presides over a larger operational space thanks to Istanbul Airport, Aycı said. ""The third runway to open at Istanbul Airport in 2020 will ease the traffic density,"" Aycı added. When the third runway goes live, it will be possible to do an aircraft landing and takeoff every 43 seconds, or more than 2,000 planes a day, he added.

Turkish Airlines is continuing to expand its fleet with next-generation aircraft while replacing older models, Aycı said. By the end of 2019, the airline had 351 aircraft, including 98 wide-body, 229 narrow-body and 24 cargo planes, up from 332 at the beginning of the year. ""With our current fleet size, we rank 10th among the passenger airlines globally,"" Aycı said. ""Among the top 10, we have the fourth-youngest fleet."" He added that 28 more aircraft will be added to the fleet in 2020, stressing that the company is open to rental options.

Capacity rising

Despite having to ground Boeing 737 Max aircraft and a delay in the delivery of the A321 Neo aircraft, Turkish Airlines posted a 2.7% rise in its capacity between January and November 2019, Aycı noted. This came despite 12 planes from the fleet being grounded and 12 more aircraft's delivery being delayed, he explained.

Boeing's top-selling 737 Max was grounded worldwide after crashes which killed hundreds of people and cost the company billions of dollars. On Tuesday, Turkish Airlines announced that Boeing had agreed to compensate it for losses caused by the grounded and undelivered planes. ""Boeing will cover some of our losses and the revenue that we cannot generate because of aircraft being grounded and out of use,"" the carrier said in a statement.

In the first 11 months of 2019, the flag carrier served 68.8 million passengers. ""Despite an 11.5% contraction in the domestic market in Turkey, we welcomed 28.3 million passengers taking domestic flights, boosting our market share by 2.5 points,"" Aycı said. The number of passengers carried on international flights rose 3.5% to 40.4 million, he underlined.

Turkish Airlines has 15 subsidiaries and joint ventures including Turkish Technic, Turkish Cargo, Turkish Ground Services, Turkish Opet Aviation Fuels and Sun Express. Touching on Turkish Cargo's operations, Aycı said the company had kept growing despite the global air cargo sector shrinking by 3.5%.

""Despite these unfavorable market conditions and having to carry out our cargo operations at two different airports, we posted an increase of 9.5% in cargo volume to 1.4 million tons,"" Aycı stressed. Turkish Cargo posted an impressive $452 million in revenue in the first three quarters, he added.",1.3333333333333333,3.0,1.0,1.6666666666666667,2.333333333333333,1.0,1.0," State-of-art Istanbul Airport will be fully operational for a full year in 2020 .

77,78,Washington ends vehicle emissions testing on Jan. 1,"Starting today, vehicle emissions testing is history","Editors note: The above video was recorded earlier this year.

As of Jan. 1, 2020, Washington drivers will no longer take an emissions test to renew their registration.

The emissions program is ending based on a plan passed in the state Legislature in 2005. The Washington Department of Ecology had projected that Washington's air quality would improve enough by 2020 to end the program, which started in 1982.

Five counties currently require emissions testing: Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish, and Spokane Counties.

Last year, approximately 750,000 vehicles required testing. That number is down from 1.2 million a few years prior.

“When we began the emission check program back in 1982, air pollution from carbon monoxide and ozone was a serious concern in many of our biggest cities,” said Kathy Taylor, the manager of the Air Quality program for the Washington Department of Ecology. “Today, new cars are much, much cleaner than in decades past, which means we can continue to improve our state’s air quality without these regular tests.”

Officials stress this verdict will not hinder Washington’s fight against climate change, which focused on carbon monoxide emissions.

Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses that face a greater threat to the environment were not tested.

Vehicles remain the largest source of carbon pollution in Washington. Supporting zero-emission vehicles through Washington’s clean car standards and advocating for public transit are among ways state officials have been addressing the ongoing problem of pollution.

Ending the program will affect about 180 people who work for Applus, the contractor that operates testing stations. About a dozen employees at the Department of Ecology and several independent testing and repair stations will be impacted by the program's end.

Administrators have been working with the employees to prepare for the shutdown and help them find other positions.

EVERETT — The dread of driving a clunker to an emissions test — and maybe facing an expensive fix — is over.

After 38 years, Tuesday is the final day vehicles must be analyzed for carbon monoxide spewing from the exhaust pipe. The $15 tests were required in regions covering most of Clark, King, Pierce, Snohomish and Spokane counties. Failing a test meant getting exhaust system repairs, although that requirement was waived if the cost exceeded $150.

Stricter emission standards for new cars and trucks, enacted by the Legislature, took effect in 2008. Vehicles newer than the 2009 model year were excluded from testing, as were vehicles older than 25 years. The law created an ever-shrinking number of vehicles that were required to be tested.

At the height of Washington’s testing program in 2011, nearly 1.3 million vehicles got emissions checks. In 2017, just 12% of all licensed vehicles in the state were checked. Last year, about 750,000 tests were conducted.

“When we began the emission check program back in 1982, air pollution from carbon monoxide and ozone was a serious concern in many of our biggest cities,” said Kathy Taylor, manager of the Washington Department of Ecology air quality program, in a news release. “Today, new cars are much, much cleaner than in decades past, which means we can continue to improve our state’s air quality without these regular tests.”

Given the trend of cleaner engines and stricter emission requirements for new vehicles, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency became convinced that air quality was not likely to deteriorate. Washington will continue monitoring air quality and must prove it will improve without emissions testing.

“If we see consistent high levels of air pollution, we are required under both the state and federal clean air acts to come up with a plan to reduce pollution and protect air quality,” said Andrew Wineke, a spokesman for the state Department of Ecology’s air quality program.

The end of emissions testing also means the end of a niche industry in Washington. About 180 people work for Applus, which operated testing stations, including in Everett, Marysville and Lynnwood. Another dozen Ecology employees will be affected by the program closing. The company and the state office worked with those employees to prepare for the shutdown.

When the EPA enacted air quality standards, it was to improve human health. Fine particulates, such as from forest fires, fossil fuel combustion or tree pollen, can aggravate respiratory and cardiovascular disease, reduce lung function and might be linked to lung cancer, according to the EPA.

“When we started the emission check program, parts of our state were threatened by high levels of carbon monoxide, ozone and particulate pollution — with levels sometimes above federal standards,” Wineke said. “Today, every part of Washington meets federal air quality standards.”

Washington’s emissions testing program started in 1982 with six test sites in King and Snohomish counties.

In 1980, the EPA’s air quality index included 11 days that were deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups and four days of air unhealthy for the whole population.

To date this year, Snohomish County has had 233 good days, 39 days with moderate air quality, one unhealthy day for sensitive groups and no generally unhealthy or very unhealthy days. The remaining days had particulate levels too small to measure.

A 1990 federal clean air law made emissions testing mandatory and resulted in the addition of testing facilities in 1993 for urbanized areas that weren’t meeting standards.

Starting in 2002, technicians plugged into a computer’s on-board diagnostics port to get a reading for most cars. That led to issues with Volkswagen vehicles equipped with 2- and 3-liter diesel engines that had emission-cheating devices which violated federal and state Clean Air Acts.

The settlement with the German auto company helped pay for electric buses in the Mukilteo, Snohomish and Stanwood-Camano school districts, and Everett Transit.

Washington’s climate won’t be affected much by the end of emissions testing. The program’s aim was to reduce toxics in the form of pollution like carbon monoxide, whereas carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are the primary drivers of climate change.

“Vehicles are still the largest source of carbon pollution in Washington — accounting for about 45% of our total emissions,” Wineke said.

NOPD homicide detectives are investigating two homicide scenes as of Wednesday night.

The first shooting of the year happened in New Orleans East.

According to New Orleans police, officers were dispatched to the 1100 block of Kinneil Road around 2 p.m. to investigate the shooting. When they arrived, they found a man with a gunshot wound to his chest. The victim was transported to the hospital by EMS, where he died.

During the investigation, police determined that the shooting occurred in the 10900 block of Willowbrae Drive, close to the corner of Morrison and Wright roads. The victim had fled to Kinneil Road after being wounded.

The second shooting happened in Central City, near the intersection of Louisiana and Claiborne Avenue.

Police were dispatched to the report of a car crash at the intersection and found the vehicle crashed into a utility pole. Inside, the driver had been shot multiple times. He was taken to the hospital where he later died.

Police say a woman was struck by a vehicle at the same crime scene, but it is still unknown if that case is related to the shooting. Her injuries are unknown.

Still digesting the Xmas TV offerings, Susan Hill's Ghost Story (C5) proved once again that even the scariest plot cannot do much scaring when the action is interrupted every 10 minutes by an advert break. The season's other notable ghost story proved something else. It is that just because a celebrity has proved himself a brilliant actor and writer in the past, it doesn't mean everything he touches will always turn to gold. Mark Gatiss's adaptation of the M R James yarn Martin's Close (BBC4) was about as scary as an old sock.

Hundreds of social-media users (in other words, a mob) want the prominent anti-Brexit barrister Jolyon Maugham prosecuted for allegedly killing a fox with a baseball bat to protect his chickens. The snag with online justice is that in a case like this you never know whether the masses want him punished for a) whacking a fox, b) being anti-Brexit, or c) being a barrister.

What we do know is that when animals are involved, all sense of proportion vanishes. I recall some years ago a reader suggesting a suitable punishment for a defendant who had killed a dog. It began with using an industrial sander to flay him alive and then rolling him in rock salt before putting him out of his agony with a bullet. Another reader took the view that a bullet was far too merciful.

If there is a lesson to learn from this backyard drama it is that we live in an age when if you really must kill an animal, no matter what the circumstances, it is probably wise to keep quiet about it. Especially if you have a name like Jolyon.","Australia speedster Peter Siddle has expressed his thoughts on how he wanted to bid goodbye to international cricket earlier in the year.

Siddle has announced his retirement from cricket on Sunday (December 29) and later on while speaking to ESPNcricinfo, the fast-bowler claimed how he wanted to retire right after the Ashes Series.

Siddle's final appearances in Test cricket for the kangaroos was during the 2019 Ashes series. However, he was told by the country's cricketing board to put a hold to his retirement plans.

""JL, Painey and I, we chatted about it early on in the Ashes series, there was a possibility (of finishing in England) ""But there was a bit of back-and-forth about the chances of maybe being able to do it back home if things fall into place,"" Siddle said.

""I was pretty content to do it over there, but that small, little hope that maybe I might get a chance back in Australia in front of family and friends, I was happy to take the gamble and see if it happened.""

Since making his Test debut against India in 2008, Siddle earned 67 caps for the Aussies in the longest format of the game and picked up 221 wickets with an average of 30.6.

""Obviously it didn't, but very content with the career I've had. As a young kid, I never thought I'd play one, let alone play 67, so very happy.""

81,82,"Austrian Conservatives, Greens Strike Coalition Deal",Austria’s Conservatives and Greens agree on coalition government,"VIENNA - Austrian conservative leader Sebastian Kurz struck a coalition deal on Wednesday with the Greens to ensure his return to power and bring the left-wing party into government for the first time, three months after Kurz won a parliamentary election.

The deal marked a swing left for Kurz, whose last coalition was with the far-right Freedom Party. It also means Austria will join fellow European Union member states Sweden and Finland in having the Greens in government, albeit in a junior role, at a time of growing calls for urgent action on climate change.

After a final round of coalition talks on New Year's Day and two days of leaks of new Cabinet members' names, Kurz and his Greens counterpart said they had struck a deal, as widely expected.

They held off, however, on providing details of their plans. Those will be presented to the public Thursday.

""We have reached an agreement,"" Kurz told reporters standing next to Greens leader Werner Kogler.

The two will become chancellor and vice chancellor of the new government, and the Greens will control just four of 15 ministries, roughly reflecting their performance in the September 29 election, which Kurz's People's Party won with 37.5% of the vote. The Greens came in fourth with 13.9%.

""It is possible to reduce the tax burden and to ecologize the tax system,"" Kurz said, referring to core campaign pledges of each party and hinting at the deal's contents. The Greens said they wanted an investment package in environmental measures and to make products that damage the environment more expensive.","Austria's Conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz on Wednesday agreed to form a coalition government with the Greens after a final round of talks capping almost three months of negotiations.

It will mark the first time the Green party has been in power, after Kurz's alliance with the far-right collapsed in a corruption scandal and triggered elections in September.

Kurz's People's Party (OeVP) and the Greens made gains in the election, bringing them together in unlikely negotiations given the 33-year-old's carefully groomed image as a hardliner on immigration.

""The OeVP and Greens have agreed on a government programme together,"" a Greens representative with knowledge of the negotiations, who declined to be named, told AFP.

An OeVP official confirmed the same to AFP. The two parties' leaders are to make a statement later Wednesday.

'Huge stretch'

Despite progress to bridge the significant gaps, observers said the new government would face challenges after Kurz's previous rule with the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) saw a raft of anti-immigration measures passed, sharply dividing Austrians.

""2020 as a political year of change"" ran the main online headline of the Kurier daily earlier Wednesday.

Both the OeVP and the Greens will be hard-pressed to show they have not compromised too much on their key principals and campaign promises when they present the joint government programme, which is expected Thursday.

""From his (Kurz's) perspective, it's a huge stretch and it's also a danger that over time he might lose some of the voters he gained from the Freedom Party,"" analyst Thomas Hofer told AFP.

In the September polls, the OeVP managed to pick up disenchanted FPOe voters, getting 37.5 percent in total.

The Greens secured 13.9 percent of the vote, their best-ever result, due to the environment replacing immigration as top concern in the country of 8.8 million people.

Trend setter?

Hofer said other European countries, such as Germany, could also see Conservative-Green party coalitions in the future. Sweden, Finland, Lithuania and Luxemburg already have Greens in government.

""Kurz is setting a certain trend maybe ahead of time, and this is certainly something also on the international stage that he would be able to sell,"" he said.

Hofer described Greens chief Werner Kogler, who is expected to be vice-chancellor, as a ""pragmatist"" who had stabilised the party.

The 58-year-old took on the leadership after the party lost all their parliamentary seats in a shock defeat in 2017, largely due to infighting and splits.

A congress of the party's almost 280 delegates must still endorse the coalition agreement, but they are expected to do so.

""It's a historical chance for them,"" Hofer said.

As junior coalition partner, the Greens would get four ministries, including an enlarged environment ministry that also comprises infrastructure, traffic, energy and technology, according to a party representative familiar with the negotiations.

The OeVP will maintain control of the rest, including the coveted interior ministry -- previously headed by a far-right official and embroiled in scandal -- and the finance portfolio.

Greens official Ewa Ernst-Dziedzic told the Standard daily in an interview that compromises are ""part of democracy"", and that the coalition partners would address challenges rather than ""feign harmony and sweep difficult topics under the carpet"".

The far-right FPOe -- previously riding a wave of populist sentiment seen across Europe -- was routed in the polls after the so-called ""Ibiza-gate"" graft scandal brought down their then-leader and vice-chancellor in May and caused the government to collapse.

Create successful growth through diversification

With the knowledge that a downturn will eventually hit, let’s look at diversification as an overall guiding principle when we consider growth strategies. When you diversify, it’s not only growing your business, it’s taking out an insurance policy that protects you for when business slows.

Diversification is important for your personal investment portfolio; it’s important for your business for similar reasons. Here are some ways you can bring diversity to your business model:

Add new products and services to your catalog

Target different customer groups

Buy related companies

Establish your business in new geographic areas

Expand overseas

Expand your offerings

I’m sure you’ve asked yourself the question “What else can I sell to my customers?” If you’ve had ideas along these lines, but haven’t yet followed through on them, there probably won’t be a better time than now, so take action.

Also, consider these strategies:

Create product or service levels, then as time goes on, add attractive features to the higher-priced levels, encouraging customers to upgrade.

Bundle your products and services. Have you ever watched the TV show American Pickers? When they want to make a purchase from a reluctant seller, they “bundle” a few items together. Bundling items makes deals more attractive to both buyer and seller.

Target untapped consumers

It’s a fact of life that, over the last decade or two, the United States has become much more of a salad bowl than a melting pot, and you can analyze this from a variety of angles. We have a wide range of language and ethnic groups that tend to maintain their identities, and we also have the East and West Coasts versus the “flyover” states. I might also mention that we have an extreme diversity in age cohorts, like the baby boomers, millennials, Gen-Xers, Generation Z, and more to come!

Who are your current typical customers? How can your product or service be tweaked to make inroads into other groups of consumers? Let’s take Spanish-speaking consumers as an example. If you watch any of the sports channels, you’ll notice that even on the English-language broadcasts they promote their Spanish-language channels. They know that although Spanish-speaking sports fans are watching their English broadcasts, if they can move them to their Spanish channel, they will create a more loyal and avid viewer.

Grow through acquisitions

There are two basic ways to go here: acquire competitors or acquire suppliers. A third strategy might be to acquire companies that are somewhat related to your industry or share a customer base.

A good thing about acquiring one or more of your suppliers (vertical integration) is that your competitors probably use the same suppliers. If your competitors continue to buy from the companies you acquire, you’re getting a bit of their sales. If your competitors move to different suppliers, you’ve made life a little more difficult for them.

Expand domestically

Remember the Great Recession? It would have been far worse had it not been for Texas, which continued to grow through much of the Great Recession while every other state was still struggling.

There are major population migration streams between states right now, which strongly impacts certain urban areas through loss of residents and a boom in residents. With apologies to the cities that made the shrinking list, these demographics represent bandwagons to jump on and sinking ships to abandon, at least when you’re devising plans to grow your business.

Expand overseas

With the advent of the internet and convenient international shipping, expanding into foreign markets is easier now than it has ever been. A musician friend of mine was telling me recently how he bought a piece of gear from a seller in Australia, and how a friend of his who owns a music store has done a great job selling to overseas buyers.

The benefits are many: Not only can you realize new revenue, you can connect to new talent, discover foreign investment opportunities, boost your reputation, and more.

At some point, you’ll need to deal with various currencies, and fortunately there’s been an explosion in online Forex broker sites. That’s good, but it can also be confusing. It’s smart to start your Forex broker search at an overview site where you can customize filters like the one found on FX-List.com; you’ll save yourself some time.

There’s also a lot of information available from the government to help you get started selling overseas. Check out the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council and Export.gov. Sometimes the best initial strategy is to partner with an existing foreign company or find a distributor so you can more easily get your foot in the door.

We started this by noting the positive business climate that we’re currently enjoying. If you work hard now to expand, there’s a good chance you can continue to ride this wave for quite some time.

83,84,Financial Planning: Six tips to become wealthy in the new decade,Buying a life insurance policy? Check the claim settlement ratio of the insurer first; Here’s why,"Depending on your age and career stage, you should start or increase your crucial insurance plans.

The year 2020 isn’t just a new year; it also marks the end of a decade and the beginning of another consequential one. The next decade will have a monumental impact on all the facets of our lives, including our finances. We need to set clear plans and execute them to perfection to extract the most out of the next 10 years and accelerate our journey to achieve financial freedom. With drastic changes in cost of living expected in the next decade, how should you manage your money and what are the financial tips you should follow? We have some pointers.

Identify long-term financial goals

Correctly identifying your long-term financial goals is very important as you step into the new decade. So, whether you are in college, in a job or close to retirement, you need to identify your goals carefully. For example, college-going individuals of today would be starting a career in the coming decade, so they should prioritise repaying their education loan, building a contingency fund, saving money for their future, getting a life insurance policy and focusing on buying a car or house.

Similarly, people who are in the middle of their careers should focus on goals such as to repay their home loan quickly, stay adequately insured, and build up a fund for their children’s future. And those about to retire should focus on the financial goals pertaining to becoming debt-free and retiring with an adequate corpus which can help them maintain the same standard of living when their income sources deplete.

Invest keeping inflation in mind

The average inflation in the last decade had been lower than the inflation in the decade previous to that. In the next decade, the average inflation is expected to remain slightly lower than this decade. So, the rates in fixed interest instruments like PPF, bank FDs, etc., are expected to fall. The equity market is expected to become more stable and robust. So, while investing your money, you should factor in the impact of inflation on the returns. Diversify your portfolio adequately and take investment risk strictly as per your risk appetite. You may invest in instruments like PPF, NPS, mutual funds, sovereign gold bonds, ETFs, etc.

The emergency fund plays a vital role in boosting your confidence during an adverse situation. So, whether you are young, in the middle of your career or a retiree, keep an emergency fund worth at least six months of your expenses to take on any kind of financial distress. Keep increasing the size of the emergency fund as your cost of living and responsibilities change in the future.

Fine-tune your insurance plans

Depending on your age and career stage, you should start or increase your crucial insurance plans. If you would start a career in the coming decade, you should get life and health insurance policy with adequate risk cover. However, if you already have these policies, you should fine-tune your insurance policies. Medical inflation is highest in comparison to other forms of inflation, so it’s important to stay adequately insured and avoid big expenses related to hospitalisation. Similarly, you should be ready to save dependent family members from financial hardship by getting a life insurance cover of at least 10 to 20 times your current annual income.

Rent or buy a house? Make your choice

Housing is going to be a big challenge in the next decade because the land bank is limited, and with a growing population, property demand is expected to increase substantially. So, make your choice now, whether you would be comfortable living in a rented home or would like to buy a home. In either case, make it a goal and start channelising your savings and investment returns to achieve your goal on time.

Plan for your children’s higher education

Higher education costs have seen a major spike in the current decade and things are unlikely to change in the next one too. So, plan to raise an adequate fund for your kid’s education as early as possible in your career so that you can avoid taking a loan at the end of your career. Set a separate financial goal to that end and consider regular investments in tools like PPF, SSY, SIPs, etc.

The need for life insurance is to get financial security in case something happens to the policyholder. While buying a life insurance policy, most look at the premium they need to pay and choose an insurance policy. However, that’s where most policyholders make the mistake – the moment of truth for a life insurance company is at the time of settling a claim.

The claim settlement ratio of a company is an indicator of the number of claims they have settled over the intimations received by the insurance company. Yusuf Pachmariwala, Executive Vice President and Head of Operations, Tata AIA Life Insurance, says “The claim settlement ratio reveals the percentage of claims the insurer has paid out during a financial year. Hence, the higher the ratio, the more confidence consumers will have on the life insurer while buying a policy, as it is reflective of the company’s commitment to its consumers.”

The claim settlement ratio reflects the overall risk management ability of the insurer. It demonstrates how efficiently the insurer has implemented the necessary technology and process to weed out applications that are not genuine. “Pure protection policies (where there’s no savings component) are more prone to frauds and consequently have a lower settlement ratio,” says an HDFC Life Spokesperson’. Hence, while comparing claim settlement ratios across insurance companies, pay attention to the experience of the insurer, the book size, product mix, and portfolio vintage.

Note that, low pending claim ratio indicates the efficiency of the life insurer, indicting how quickly it decides on the claims it received during the financial year. At the same time, while purchasing life insurance, policyholders should also look at factors other than claim settlement ratios, such as brand, financial robustness of the insurer, product suitability, governance standards, and superior customer service.

What are the things you should look at while buying a Life insurance policy?

As a policyholder, there are various criteria you should look at before opting for an insurance policy. Note that, the product chosen should also meet your financial goals. Pachmariwala, of Tata AIA Life Insurance, says “The process of buying a life insurance policy should start with an assessment of one’s protection need. As a rule of thumb, one should have 10 to 15 times of annual income, depending on one’s age, as their life insurance cover. Having decided on the amount of adequate life cover, one should decide on the kind of product and product features one wants.”

Requirements and needs of every individual keep changing as per the changing life stages of the policyholder – such as planning to purchase a home, children’s education, retirement planning, etc. It is imperative to ensure that the insurance policy you choose adequately compensates for the income loss keeping in mind factors like future income, changing interest rates, rising costs, etc.

First-time life insurance buyer, should consider buying a Term plan. These policies offer larger financial cover at a low-value premium, especially, if bought, in the early earning phase of the policyholder’s life span. There are additional benefits and features including coverage till a very high age which some insurers offer.

From a premium paying perspective, if the choice is that of a regular paying product, policyholders should plan and space premium payments such that continuity of the policy is maintained. Lapsation of policies leads to loss of benefits and life cover for the policyholder and the beneficiaries.",1.0,2.6666666666666665,1.0,2.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,1.0,1.0," The next decade will have a monumental impact on all the facets of our lives, including our finances .

84,85,Russia’s Hypersonic ICBM Is Operational. So What?,The future of Putin’s information autocracy,"Russia’s Avangard hypersonic ICBM system is now operational.

Russian state media sounded a triumphal tone in the December 27th announcement that the first Avangards are now ready for launch, even specifying the exact hour of combat readiness for the nuclear-armed hypersonic glider.

“The Avangard strategic missile system has been put on combat duty at 10 a.m. today,” Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told President Vladimir Putin. The weapon was deployed with a missile division in the Orenburg region 900 miles southeast of Moscow.

Avangard is a nuclear-armed boost-glide system. The glider is boosted high into the atmosphere atop a Sarmat ICBM, and then glides down to its target at what Russia claims is a speed of Mach 27. The weapon was spurred by Moscow’s fears that the U.S. missile defense program will eventually be capable of intercepting and destroying conventional Russian ICBMs, and thus encourage America to launch a first strike without fear of Russian nuclear retaliation. But while conventional ICBM warheads descend from space at Mach 20-plus, they follow predictable ballistic trajectories: a winged hypersonic glider can maneuver within the atmosphere to avoid interception.

Putin “has the Avangard’s ability to evade U.S. missile defense systems,” noted the Moscow Times. “Russia said it showed the missile system to U.S. inspectors last month as part of a bilateral arms control treaty ahead of its deployment.”

“Officials say the ICBM flies 27 times faster than the speed of sound. During the last known tests that took place in December 2018, the Avangard hit a practice target 6,000 kilometers [3,728 miles] away.”

Putin recently claimed that “this weapon of the future can penetrate both existing and any future missile defense systems.” Other Russian hypersonic weapons include the nuclear-armed Khinzal air-launched missile, and the Zircon anti-ship missile.

Interestingly, Putin also described Russia being the first nation to deploy hypersonic missiles as being “a unique situation in our contemporary history where they’re trying to catch up.” Which suggests that Putin considers it the norm for Russia to be trying to catch up in the arms race.

From Germany’s Adolf Hitler to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and from Italian dictator Benito Mussolini to Chinese leader Mao Zedong (毛澤東), the world’s 20th-century dictators took to heart Niccolo Machiavelli’s famous dictum that “it is better to be feared than loved.”

Yet, most modern dictators seem more concerned about maintaining their people’s loyalty not by giving them what they want, but by manipulating them into thinking that they already have it. Nobody executes this approach more masterfully than Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Although Putin’s approval ratings have declined considerably over the past few years, they remain high, with polls indicating that 61 percent of Russians evaluate his performance positively.

If a presidential election were held today, 44 percent would vote for Putin. No other candidate would receive double-digit percentage support.

Putin certainly does not owe his popularity to his economic leadership. Since recapturing the presidency in 2012, he has consistently failed to deliver on promises of reform, higher productivity and investment, and improvements in Russians’ standard of living. His government also does not seem to have any plan to kick-start stagnant GDP growth.

The IMF expects Russia’s annual GDP growth to average less than 2 percent over the next five years. Next year, Russia’s share of global GDP (in purchasing parity terms) is expected to drop below 3 percent for the first time in modern times.

In nominal terms, this ratio will be even lower: an estimated 1.8 percent. Most importantly, the real incomes of Russian households are 10 percent lower than they were in 2014 — and show no signs of rising.

So what explains Putin’s enduring popularity? The answer — for Putin and other modern autocrats — lies in the ability to control the information that people receive, which enables a leader to convince most of the population that, despite the regime’s imperfections, it is the country’s best option.

In the digital age, this is no easy feat. A growing number of educated citizens — or “informed elites” — recognize the system’s deficiencies. It is thus imperative for autocrats to prevent these elites from communicating the truth to the public.

TARGETED REPRESSION

Repression plays an important role here. However, far from the widely publicized mass repression of the past — aimed at scaring off all potential opposition — today’s repression is targeted and, critically, deniable.

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was officially barred from running in the 2018 presidential election not for political reasons, but because of his fraud conviction, which was subsequently overturned by the European Court of Human Rights.

This approach enabled Putin to maintain the pretense that he secured power in a free and fair election.

Modern informational autocrats also make extensive use of censorship. Russia ranks in the bottom 20 percent of the press-freedom rankings compiled by Freedom House and Reporters Without Borders. Freedom House’s Freedom on the Net Index shows that the Internet is less free in Russia than in Belarus, Kazakhstan or Turkey, reflecting the importance of online censorship in an informational autocracy with high Internet penetration.

According to the Google Transparency Report, Russia leads the world in official requests to remove online content. In the first half of last year, Russia placed more than 10,000 requests to remove content. The second-place country, Turkey, had just 1,000 requests.

A Miami County judge recently scheduled the trial of Ethan Cain of Marion and Joshua Kean of LaFountaine to begin April 13 in the killing of 22-year-old Drake Smith, the Kokomo Tribune reported.

Both men face felony charges of murder, obstruction of justice and robbery resulting in serious bodily injury, while Kean also is charged with assisting a criminal.

Cain, 23, and Kean, 25, allegedly beat Smith to death with a metal pipe in May 2018 in the Frances Slocum State Forest, near Peru.

Police said both men were part of a plot organized by 19-year-old Brittany Morris of Jonesboro to rob Smith of drugs and money. Cain and Kean allegedly attacked the Summitville man after a party in the forest.

Police said Cain, Kean and Morris then fled the scene with Smith’s clothing, cash, drugs, beer and a small speaker. Kean and Cain were arrested days later in southern California.

Morris is set to stand trial in June on several charges, including aiding or inducing murder.

“I was able to kill two birds with one stone, get my teammates there, coaching staff, my family, my friends, people that’s been around for quite a while and we had a heck of a time,” he said. “So it was another opportunity for us to bond, which we did. And if it brings us closer, then fantastic. That’s what it’s all about for me, bringing us closer to family as possible.”

The Lakers ended 2019 pretty tight-knit, with a strong body of work behind them. Leading the Western Conference standings and finishing a challenging December slate at 9-5, some of their hardest work is behind them even though the bulk of the schedule remains.

The year wrapped on an upbeat note with wins over the Portland Trail Blazers and Dallas Mavericks. After that second victory, Coach Frank Vogel had a chance to look at the footage of his team holding the No. 1 offense in the NBA to just 95 points – to his surprise, he saw some opportunities where his defense (104.8 defensive rating, No. 7 in the NBA) could be even better.

That’s the Lakers’ 2019 resolution: They’re still looking for the perfect performance.

“It’s just reason for optimism that we still have a long way to go and a lot of room for improvement,” he said. “It’s exciting what we can be.”

A big part of that has been success against the teams they are supposed to beat: The Lakers are 17-0 against teams under .500 this season. They’ll have an opportunity to extend that perfection with upcoming home games against Phoenix, New Orleans, Detroit and New York.

The Lakers warmed to the challenge of their tough schedule last month, playing a host of teams bound for the playoffs. The concern, Vogel acknowledged, is that over a third of the way in against less-than-stellar competition, complacency can sneak in.

“It’s a different sort of stretch right now,” he said. “I think we begin to enter the dog days of the NBA season, which is like now until All-Star break where it gets a little monotonous and there’s a little bit of a grind and hopefully we can get through that stretch. And then once All-Star break hits, you’re in the home stretch after that.”

One of the factors the Lakers feel is in their favor is chemistry. Multiple players have cited the 1-through-15 chemistry on the roster as a strength, and James’ birthday party was the latest event where the Lakers have largely shown up off the court as a group.

James pointed to his youth league days as a model: When he was a young player, he and his teammates would go to parks or malls and play video games together.

“Not only did it influence the way I play on the court, having an effect on how I play today, it also had an influence of how I grew up with my friends, too, and having that brotherhood,” he said. “If you know anything about my childhood, the guys that I grew up playing ball are still around, they’re still like my best friends.”

The same concept is important to his NBA teams, James said, which is among the reasons everyone was invited. The feeling of the Lakers is that off-court chemistry will help form on-court bonds that can help them in competitive games.

It also leads to some nice post-party texts.

“The best thing about it is that my teammates said how much of a time they had,” he said. “My family and my friends had a heck of a time. Got a lot of messages this morning saying how much fun it was, how much love was in the air. So that’s what makes it cool for me. The people around me had a good time.”

For us here at the Packet we look back on a successful year, as more people than ever before are reading what we write.

That growth has come on our digital platform, thepacket.co.uk

At the close of 2019, more than five million pages had been read on our website – around two million more than in 2018.

We continue to have a loyal audience in print too and we thank those who believe that our journalism is worth paying money for each week.

In 2020 we as a news outlet and, indeed, an industry, continue to fight on various fronts.

Aside from battling to secure the advertising revenue needed to survive, one that regularly rears its rather ugly head is the concept of 'fake news'. This is a term that gets thrown around all too frequently, usually to express dismay at a story that one simply doesn't agree with.

The actual definition is the deliberate spread of disinformation or hoaxes via the media. A few weeks ago the editor of a Yorkshire newspaper had to do battle with the 'fake news' claims and it's a great example of why trusted local news is more important than ever as we head into a new decade.

The story in question was about a young boy who had to sleep on a hospital floor because there were no beds.

Social media went into meltdown, slamming the newspaper, saying it simply couldn't be true.

The newspaper explained how it had done the basic journalism of verifying the story with the hospital before publication, while those on social media could hide behind a moniker and publish spurious claims without a single check.

We had our own example recently, where one of our reporters picked up on a story via social media. That's often the way these days – but social media is merely another source and we will always then verify any information before publishing a story. This particular one involved cameras appearing in Helston. One person gave an apparent explanation on the original social media post, which resulted in another person saying ""social media wins again, who needs local newspapers?""

But what had been written wasn't right, we discovered when we asked the council about it, and we then went on to publish our story, with the correct explanation.

And that's the difference – you can't believe everything you read on social media, but when it's published under the banner of the Packet, you can be assured that it has been verified before being published.

Thank you for your support and I wish you a happy New Year.

As the Second Amendment conflict heats up across the United States, here’s another “crazy conspiracy theory” that has turned out to be true.

The United Nations is hiring in New York. What positions are they trying to fill?

English-speaking DISARMAMENT, DEMOBILIZATION, AND REINTEGRATION OFFICERS.

This job was posted the day after Christmas. So for all the folks who have been saying “nobody is trying to take your guns” you might want to read this job listing and reconsider your opinion.

Is this in response to the Virginia crisis?

You may recall that citizens of Virginia have become outraged recently by new laws that are likely to pass this month, effectively banning all semi-automatic weapons. Sanctuary counties, cities, and municipalities now cover all but the most urban parts of the state. These sanctuaries have vowed to support the Second Amendment and are refusing to enforce unconstitutional gun laws.

In response, a member of the state congress suggested that Governor Northam could call up the National Guard to disarm residents of Virginia despite the wishes of local governments. In response to that, at least one county has formed a militia and others are expected to spring up. The state’s Attorney General says that these sanctuaries carry no legal weight.

Despite the AG’s opinion and threats from the state government, Virginians appear to have no plans to give up their guns or register them. Many members of law enforcement entities and the National Guard have said that they will not act on unconstitutional orders.

One has to wonder if this is why the UN is hiring “disarmament officers?”

What is the job description?

Here are the responsibilities for the new hires, as per the United Nations job listing.

Within delegated authority, the Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration Officer will be responsible for the following duties:

• Acts as a Focal Point for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) components for two to three missions, responsible for planning, support to implementation and evaluation;

• Participates in DPO and Integrated Task Force planning meetings for the establishment of a new peacekeeping mission with a potential DDR component;

• Provides technical assistance to peace negotiations;

• Participates in technical assessment missions;

• Advises, develops and reviews (as appropriate) initial DDR functional strategy and concept of operations for further development into a full programme by the DDR component and the National DDR Commission;

• Drafts and reviews DDR inputs to SG report, code cables, and talking points;

• Develops initial result-based framework and budget for new DDR components in new mission;

• Liaises with UNDP and donor community to raise voluntary contributions for DDR programmes;

• Presents and/or defends new and subsequent DDR budgetary requirements in the ACABQ and the 5th Committee of the General Assembly;

• Develops staffing structure and terms of reference for a DDR component, including terms of integration with other UN agencies, funds and programmes;

• Provides technical clearance for applicants to DDR units in new and ongoing missions;

• Provides Headquarters support in planning the civilian and military logistics support for DDR;

• Continually reviews DDR programme strategy and implementation through relevant documents, reports and code cables;

• Conducts field missions to assess implementation of established DDR programmes;

• Identifies potential problems and issues to be addressed and suggests remedies to DDR units in the field;

• Liaises with Member States, UN actors and other DDR interested partners to represent the mission’s DDR component at the Headquarters level;

• Establishes and maintains an outreach network with CSOs and IGOs active in the area of DDR.

• Supports the doctrine development work in the area of DDR in the department, with the Inter-Agency Working Group (IAWG) on DDR and other relevant national and international actors working on DDR issues;

• Contributes to Department-level or Policy Committee-level policy development work on DDR and related issues;

• Maintains and further develops the Integrated DDR Standards – a set of inter-agency policies, guidelines and procedures on DDR;

• On behalf of the Chief of the DDR Section, co-chairs the IAWG on DDR, contributes to bringing coherence to the interaction of the UN system and its partners on DDR;

• Supervises the Associate Expert (Junior Professional Officer) in the development and maintenance of the web-based United Nations DDR Resource Centre;

• Liaises with others (UN, regional organisations and Member States) providing DDR.

Other duties as required. (source)

Also notable is the required language fluency – English – and the desired experience.

Seven years of relevant experience in disarmament affairs, political analysis or in national military or paramilitary service, preferably related to the design, implementation or review of DDR. (source)

Employees would answer to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

As per the UN, here are some specifics about this job description. Of special note:

Disarmament is the collection, documentation, control and disposal of small arms, ammunition, explosives and light and heavy weapons of combatants and often also of the civilian population. Disarmament also includes the development of responsible arms management programmes. (source)

As well, the UN especially wants women to apply for this job, citing gender equality. But is it possible they think that a gun owner might have more ethical difficulty firing on a woman trying to take their weapons than a man?

The US is no longer part of the UN Arms Trade Treaty.

You may recall back in 2013, the United Nations convinced then-Secretary of State John Kerry to sign a treaty that “unequivocally bans arms transfers that are in violation of a U.N. arms embargo or that exporters have reason to know will be used to commit genocide and other grievous war crimes.”

In 2013, the US signed the UN Arms Trade Treaty but that signature was never ratified. Last April, President Trump officially withdrew from the international gun control treaty.

However noble that may sound, anti-gun control activists were concerned this would lead to the UN being able to disarm Americans on US soil.

So why is the UN looking for English-speaking disarmament experts?

Don’t be silly, “no one is coming to take your guns.”

How many times has someone told you not to worry – that nobody is coming to take your guns away? That all they want is “common-sense gun laws?”

In light of the current political climate and this job listing, I’d say that is an outright a lie.

What do you think about this job listing? Alarming or not? Please share your thoughts in the comments.

Activist Greta Thunberg attends a climate strike outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm on December 20. During an interview Monday, Greta said she doubts she would have talked to President Trump at last fall’s climate summit in New York because “he’s not listening to the scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me?” (Pontus Lundahl/TT via AP)

Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg said Monday that talking to President Trump at a United Nations summit on global warming would have been a waste of time, because he would not have paid attention.

In an interview with BBC radio’s “Today” program, for which she was the guest editor Monday, Greta also said that she regarded personal attacks on her as funny and that she hoped to go back to having a normal life.

A video of the 16-year-old Swedish campaigner giving Trump what media described as a “death stare” at a U.N. climate summit in New York in September went viral on social media. Trump has questioned climate science and is pulling the United States out of the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.

Asked what she would have said to the president if they had spoken, Greta said: “Honestly, I don’t think I would have said anything because obviously he’s not listening to scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me?

“So I probably wouldn’t have said anything. I wouldn’t have wasted my time,” she said.

This month Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called Greta “a brat.” Trump has said on Twitter she needs to work on her anger management problem.

“Those attacks are just funny because they obviously don’t mean anything,” she said. “I guess of course it means something — they are terrified of young people bringing change which they don’t want — but that is just proof that we are actually doing something and that they see us as some kind of threat.”

Greta came to world attention when she began a grass-roots campaign at age 15 by skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament. The protests have inspired millions of young people to take action against climate change.

Thunberg, who was named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year for 2019, said becoming an activist had helped rescue her from the depression she had previously been suffering.

The teenager rejoined activists outside the Swedish parliament this month after four months of overseas trips to attend climate conferences in New York and Madrid.

“I hope I won’t have to sit outside the Swedish parliament for long. I hope I don’t have to be a climate activist anymore,” she said, adding she was looking forward to returning to school in August.

“I just want to be just as everyone else. I want to educate myself and be just like a normal teenager.”

“I don’t think that would be a good idea for Iran. It wouldn’t last very long,” he bluntly said when asked by reporters about a potential war with Iran.

The remarks were made only hours after Iranian-backed militiamen stormed the U.S. Embassy in Iraq’s capital of Baghdad and nearly triggered another Benghazi.

During a roughly 10-minute-long presser before the new year began, he also addressed his predictions for the U.S. economy, as well as his thoughts on North Korea’s recent antics and the Democrats’ flailing impeachment drive.

Listen:

The rest of the evening was far less somber at Mar-a-Lago’s annual black-tie New Year’s Eve gala, which Politico notes is “a $1,000-a-head event that starts with cocktails by the main pool before moving to a decadent dinner in the estate’s massive ballroom.”

“In the past, the shindig has attracted celebrities like Sylvester Stallone, Woody Allen, Rod Stewart, Serena Williams, Martha Stewart and Robert Kraft.”

This year noted guests included …

The president reportedly began the day driving to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach but quickly switched plans and left only 49 minutes after his arrival.

Though he received some criticism from the left over the perceived Obama-like optics of showing up at the resort, he himself took to Twitter later to dispute media reports that he’d actually gone on to play golf; and to note the difference between the Baghdad attack and Obama’s infamous Benghazi attack: His decision to take quick, immediate action.

91,92,Yorba Linda Approves Grant Program to Help Businesses,Support Oxnard initiatives,"7 Shares Email

Five businesses will be eligible to apply for a $2,000 grant to improve their retail environment in the first year of a new economic development program in Yorba Linda.

Editors’ Note: This dispatch is part of the Voice of OC Youth Media program, working with student journalists to cover public policy issues across Orange County. If you would like to submit your own student media project related to Orange County civics or if you have any response to this work, contact Digital Editor Sonya Quick at squick@voiceofoc.org.

The money for the program will come from the city’s share of revenue generated from the State of the City event. The city and the Yorba Linda Chamber of Commerce equally share proceeds from the annual event, which this year totaled $21,000, making $10,600 available for five grants of $2,000 maximum between now through December 2020, according to a city staff report.

The grants will assist the city’s business community in enhancing retail shopping, the report said. The program, which was unanimously approved by the City Council earlier in December, would allow merchants, retail centers, and business groups to promote their businesses.

Eligibility for the grant comes with some guidelines. A business must express a need for improvement to a building exterior or common area, according to the staff report. It must also explain how the enhancement will provide a benefit to the community and demonstrate a need for the grant that cannot be obtained through other funding options.

The application process includes a project description, plans, drawings or photos, and a budget. The city plans to review these applications within 15 days of submittal to the economic development manager with a final decision by the city manager, according to the staff report.

The City Council meets every first and third Tuesday of the month at 4845 Casa Loma Ave.","Five citizen-sponsored initiatives are being proposed for the November 2020 election in Oxnard. However, Oxnard’s leadership considers them “dangerous” and instead of placing them on the ballot, the City Council ordered staff to write independent reports to assess their financial and other impacts. Will the city staff truly act as an unbiased third party when assessing these initiatives?

I have recently been campaigning for the city to disclose and publish, for all taxpayers to see, the actual cumulative total cost of several recent memoranda of understandings with the city’s unions. The city will only disclose a value that they call total cumulative cost, even after I have repeatedly demonstrated that these values are incorrect. The city’s published total cost values understate the actual cost by millions of dollars. So, even with mandated financial reporting, will the disclosed information be accurate? And why are they just now suddenly concerned about financial impacts when they freely hand out concessions to these unions? If anything is dangerous and/or placing the city’s future in financial peril, it’s these overly generous concessions. Did the city perform an assessment to determine long-term financial impacts before doing this? Probably not since these concessions go directly to city employee pockets.

It seems to many that the city is afraid that these measures will bring about accountability and fiscal transparency to city operations. The probable real reason the city has ordered reports is to develop politically-motivated rationale to discourage voters from approving the five initiatives. Once these initiatives make it to the November ballot, I hope Oxnard voters will join me and vote “yes” to communicate our displeasure to the city leadership and reform City Hall.

Two pieces of a giant silver construction sit like a collapsed mirrorball, dwarfing the midas-touch producer as he sits inbetween, where his desk-top console resides.

Behind him, a twelve-strong all-female string section featuring Scottish Chamber Orchestra violinists Aisling O’Dea and Siun Milne, plus cellist Niamh Malloy swish out the sort of lush clusters barely heard since the Biddu Orchestra turned disco into a classical gas.

Other hearts are either framed in red as neon shapes zigzag about them, or else spiral round like Joe 90 might hatch like a Kinder toy.

Ronson moves through a set of the last decade’s bangers at a gallop.

He only pauses to don guitar for a brief guest slot from Daniel Merriweather, whose Ronson-produced mash-up of the Smiths and the Supremes on Stop Me remains sublime, despite his patter suggesting ambitions to be an international peace envoy.

Warm-ups came care of the vintage punky reggae party of Mungo’s Hi-Fi sound system and the old skool hands-in-the-air vibes of Rudimental’s Leon ‘Locksmith’ Rolle, accompanied by free-styling trumpeter Mark Crowney.

There are more hearts here, as Rolle gets the audience to make shapes with their hands.

All of which fits in with this year’s Be Together theme.

Not that there’s been much togetherness in responses to what some see as the serious mismanagement of Edinburgh’s Winter festivals.

The resultant brickbats raise serious questions regarding the event’s future - if it has one – that must be addressed.

In the meantime, Ronson’s medley of his own hits synchronised to the turn-of-year fireworks is a work of eye and ear-popping razzmatazz.

As are his slightly spooky closing renditions of Back to Black and Valerie.

The power of Amy Winehouse’s disembodied vocal is heightened by the image of her bee-hived visage that covers the stage wall.

Winehouse’s face is bent down, as if acknowledging the broken mirrorball below. All heart, as ever.","They were certainly in the party spirit.

Working over New Year can be quite the chore, so it is important to make the evening as light-hearted and fun as possible so time passes quickly.

They were certainly in the party spirit.

That certainly seemed to be the ethos of these two fun-loving security guards at Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations on Tuesday evening.

They can be seen in the video above boogying along to headline act Mark Ronson just moments before the countdown to 2020 began in Princes Street Gardens.

One attendee to the sold-out event, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Evening News that even after the camera stopped rolling, the pair continued to cut shapes throughout the evening, regularly joining in with crowds and leading the celebrations.

They said: ""It was great to see. Sometimes people who work at these events can be quite stuffy and serious, so to see these two letting their hair down was great.

""It added to the atmosphere as they danced with other people in the crowd and joined families to bust some moves. They really got people going.

""That's what Hogmanay is all about.""

This year’s Hogmanay theme, Be Together, was celebrated by bringing together tens of thousands of friends old and new to share in a warm and welcoming moment of friendship creating a fantastic atmosphere across the Street Party.

Ronson dazzled the partygoers with some of the best tracks of the decade in a full throttle count down to the midnight fireworks. Daniel Merriweather joined him for Stop Me and Shallow.

Feedback 0 / 5","U.S. and Iraqi forces at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad fired tear gas to disperse Iraqi protesters who gathered at the walls of the compound for a second day to show support for a powerful Iranian-backed Shiite militia.

Dozens of protesters and supporters of the Hashd Shaabi militia set up camp outside the gates of the embassy on Wednesday, one day after thousands converged on Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone to decry U.S. strikes that killed at least 25 militiamen on the weekend.

Several protesters set fire to the outside wall of the embassy, where heavily armed U.S. forces were seen standing on the roof of the building, witnesses said.

Some protesters suffered breathing problems from the tear gas, the witnesses added.

The U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria on Sunday targeted the Kataib Hezbollah militia group, which was blamed for an attack last week that killed a U.S. citizen.

Kataib Hezbollah, a part of the Hashd Saabi umbrella group, is independent from the Hezbollah group in Lebanon that is trained and financed by Iran.

Chanting “Death to America,” angry protesters on Tuesday broke into the U.S. embassy compound and set fire to one of its gates.

U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed the attack on Iran and said the country will “pay a very big price.”

Tehran has blasted Washington’s “irrational response” to the protests and denied any involvement.

Trump spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel-Mahdi by phone on Tuesday and “emphasised the need to protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq.”

Defense Secretary Mark Esper called on the government of Iraq to “fulfil its international responsibilities” to protect US citizens in the country.

Washington has announced that it will immediately deploy 750 soldiers to Iraq “as an appropriate and precautionary action.”",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.3333333333333333,1.0,1.3333333333333333,1.3333333333333333, Your opinions matter to us times; we need to hear from you .

95,96,Cal State Fullerton should get morale boost from victory at UCLA,,"It’s been a long nonconference season for the Cal State Fullerton men’s basketball team, which will take a 4-10 record into its final tuneup, a Friday night home game against St. Katherine, an NAIA program from San Marcos. The Titans’ Big West Conference opener against visiting Hawaii will follow on Jan. 9.

But the Titans currently can hold their heads high, thanks to their 77-74 victory at UCLA on Saturday that snapped a seven-game losing streak. Not only is it the type of win that should boost morale (it was CSF’s first win against any Power Five conference team since 2011), it came with all of the Titans’ top players on the court together for the first time this season.

“Yeah, I think what a victory like that does is it just gives this group confidence that when we do what we’re capable of doing, good things are on the other side of it,” Fullerton head coach Dedrique Taylor said Tuesday. “That’s the biggest thing for this group moving forward is we’ve just gotta continue to get better at the things that are important to us, the things that we deem necessary to win basketball games, and we’ve gotta stick to that.”

Senior Jackson Rowe was playing just his third game of the season because of a knee issue. He had 17 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and two steals. Senior guard Brandon Kamga, who missed the previous two games, scored 13 points against the Bruins.

“Obviously, it helps a tremendous amount when you have the guys that you were counting on, on the floor together,” Taylor said. “That was the first time all year we’ve had a combination of Austen (Awosika), Kamga, Davon Clare, Jackson Rowe and Vincent Lee on the floor. First time all year.

“And everybody wants to say we’re struggling and this, that and the other. Yeah, we’ve struggled to get and stay healthy. Because of that, it put us kind of behind the 8-ball in terms of some guys who maybe are not ready or some guys who can’t sustain some high-level play. It gives us depth to be able to do that.”

Rowe, a 6-foot-7 forward, is averaging 12 points and 6.3 rebounds in the three games he’s played after missing the first 11. Taylor likes what he’s seeing from the former Big West Freshman of the Year and two-time all-conference honorable mention selection.

“Yeah, I think he’s definitely what we thought he could be if, and when, healthy,” Taylor said of Rowe. “He’s a guy that’s got an unbelievable amount of experience. He plays extremely hard, he can defend pretty much 1 through 5 – for the most part – on the floor; he rebounds his position.

“And then, obviously, offensively he’s a guy who has a nice toolbox. He can go score, but he’s also a very willing passer.”

UC IRVINE SHOWS IMPROVEMENT

UC Irvine coach Russ Turner last week discussed his team’s turnovers and somewhat shoddy defense against 3-point shooting. A few days later, on Saturday night, the Anteaters went out and defeated a good Pacific team 69-56 at the Bren Events Center.

UCI entered the game averaging 15.6 turnovers after averaging only 11.9 last season when it won the Big West regular-season and tournament titles. The Anteaters had just 11 turnovers against Pacific.

“Yeah, I mean, good teams don’t turn it over and we’ve had some problems at times with that,” said Turner, who had bemoaned the number of traveling violations his players had been called for this season. “I think we only got called for one travel and maybe one illegal pick in that game.”

UCI also went into the game allowing opponents to make 36.4 percent of their 3-point shots. Moreover, the Anteaters were giving up an average of 23.1 3-point attempts per game. UCI held Pacific (12-4) to 2 for 13 from beyond the arc.

“I thought our 3-point defense was good in the Pacific game,” Turner said. “And that’s key for us. I think that’s more of a key than anything.”

UCI (8-7) plays at Harvard (10-4) on Saturday (11 a.m. PT) then opens Big West play the following Saturday night (Jan. 11) at home against Hawaii.

THIS AND THAT

Long Beach State was routed 102-63 at Florida on Saturday. But LBSU (4-11) got a nice game from sophomore guard Chance Hunter, who scored 20 points on 8-for-18 shooting, including a 3-for-6 effort from 3-point range. He had just one turnover while playing a team-high 32 minutes. He leads the team in scoring at 13.7 points per game. … Fullerton’s Awosika was named Big West Player of the week for his performance against UCLA. He had 15 points, two rebounds, three assists and two steals and made a basket with 23.2 seconds left that helped the Titans ice the game. … CSUN (4-11) on Tuesday afternoon defeated visiting Morgan State 93-82.

Cocoa is rich in polyphenols, which have significant health benefits, including reduced inflammation and improved cholesterol levels. However, processing cocoa into chocolate or other products can substantially decrease the polyphenol content.

97,98,This Edmonton man had his arm amputated. Then he kept the bones.,The Bishop of Worcester’s New Year Message 2020,"EDMONTON -- Warning: This story contains imagery which some readers may find disturbing.

Mark Holmgren was 17 years old when he borrowed his brother’s motorbike. It was a decision that would alter his life forever.

“I was just driving too fast, turned the corner and I wiped out. I tore the nerves in my shoulder. It was a brachial plexus injury and from that day I could never use it. Couldn’t move it, couldn’t feel it.”

Holmgren, now 37, carried his dysfunctional arm around for nearly two decades before deciding it was time to do something about it this year.

“At first it was: I’m going to wait, they’ll be able to fix it, they’re coming up with new stuff, give me a robotic arm, stuff like that and I’ve been waiting too long,” he recalled.

“I just decided to remove it. Move on, I guess.”

He contacted doctors at the University of Alberta hospital, who agreed to amputate his right arm in April.

However, Holmgren didn’t want to depart with his arm forever—he wanted to have it preserved.

“First they sent me a paper, I signed it, sent it back to (the doctor). He brought it into the surgery room with me and just showed me all the doctors in there and they were all like,‘Yup, we know.’”

About a month after the surgery, Holmgren got a call from the lab saying his arm was ready to be picked up.

“I carried it out of the hospital in a garbage bag,” said Holmgren. “I actually kept it in my freezer for about a month.”

He admits that shopping around and asking taxidermy businesses to clean a human arm was a bit of a challenge.

“A couple of them told me no, like right away. There was no way that they were going to touch human body parts.”

But after a few weeks of searching, Legends Taxidermy in Drayton Valley agreed to do the job.

“I went and dropped it off, and got it back just before Christmas.”

Holmgren even brought his skeletal arm to Christmas dinner with his family.

“Some of them wanted to touch it, some of them don’t want to touch it. It’s just mixed feelings when people see it.”

The Edmontonian plans to show more friends and family his limb before retiring it.

“I’m just going to keep it probably behind the sink in the kitchen. I’m happy I did it. It’s just not for everybody.”","THE QUEEN began her Christmas message by referring to the 50th anniversary of humanity’s memorable first steps on the moon. Of Neil Armstrong taking ‘a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind – and, indeed, for womankind.’ She observed that it is a reminder to us all that giant leaps often start with small steps, going on to speak of the continuing need for peace and reconciliation in our world and how this generally begins with small steps.

It was a very timely message. One of the things I have been reflecting upon since hearing it is how we can only take such steps ourselves. Watching my children take their first steps was a joyous experience precisely because I couldn’t do it for them. First steps towards peace and reconciliation can be equally exhilarating to observe, but we cannot take them on behalf of others. We can only take them ourselves.

The Queen spoke ‘of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past differences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation. And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, it’s worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.’

There has been much talk of deep division in our country since the Referendum. It strikes me that we actually have much more in common than anything that might divide us and that if we can all take some small steps of reconciliation we shall come together in exciting and unforeseen ways.

May this New Year bring you many blessings and may you share them with others.

Mr Clement Oladele, the state FRSC Sector Commander disclosed this while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Ota.

Oladele said that the lone accident happened at about 11.25 pm on Tuesday.

He explained that a Toyota Sienna Bus, with registration number, FKJ 453XW, was on a high speed when it tyres burst and in the process lost control and somersaulted into the bush.

He said that nine persons- five male adults, three female adults and a female child, were involved in the accident.

“The corpse of the female victim has been deposited at the mortuary of General Hospital, Ijebu Ode, while two of the survivors are also receiving treatment at the same hospital.

“The third survivor who is a child was taken to Ise Oluwa Clinic J3 by a good samaritan before the arrival of FRSC rescue team,” he said.

The sector commander admonished motorists to desist from using imported used tyres and also ensure that they check the expiring date on the tyres before purchasing them to avoid unnecessary loss of lives and property on the highway.

100,101,,Here Are The Good Guys With Guns The Media Doesn’t Want You To Know About,,"While media outlets breathlessly demand gun control, they often ignore stories like the one that occurred in a Texas church Sunday, when an intruder opened fire before being quickly killed by armed churchgoers.

This was yet another case of a good guy with a gun saving potentially dozens of lives. The notion of a good guy with a gun has been repeatedly derided by media outlets as a right-wing, NRA-funded narrative. However, the White Settlement shooting was far from the first example of armed Americans defending themselves, while saving the lives of others.

After a back to school event in Florida last year was interrupted by gun shots, a bystander with a gun took down the shooter and prevented any casualties. In 2012, an 18-year-old mother in Oklahoma shot dead a knife-wielding intruder, potentially saving the lives of herself and her son. The mother, Sarah McKinley would not have had the opportunity to be armed in several blue states, where the law requires you to be 21-years-old to purchase or own a firearm. Several members of Congress and 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have introduced laws that would bar adults under 21 from obtaining firearms.

A similar situation also unfolded in Oklahoma City in May 2018 at Louie’s Grill & Bar when a man opened fire on the restaurant and shot two people before being subdued by an armed patron. The only fatality in that shooting was the suspect. If all of the patrons had been unarmed, it’s possible that many innocent people could have been killed.

In August, an off-duty firefighter prevented a man carrying more than 100 rounds of ammunition from causing any damage at a Missouri Walmart. The firefighter held the man at gunpoint until police arrived, possibly preventing serious carnage in the process. Despite a good guy with a gun possibly saving lives at one of its stores, Walmart announced earlier this year that it would no longer sell handgun ammunition.

In 2012, a 71-year-old Florida man saved several lives at an internet cafe after two teenagers walked in with a baseball bat and a gun. The man, Samuel Williams, was sitting at his computer when he witnessed the incident, and quickly pulled out his .380-caliber handgun to prevent carnage.

In 2010, a 69-year-old Alabama widow shot a burglar three times to protect her home. The robbery took place at 3 a.m., but the Alabama grandmother sprung into action with her .38 snubnosed revolver to keep herself and her home safe.

In 2016, a pregnant mother of two potentially saved her life and the lives of her three children with her firearm after intruders broke into her Ohio home. Her estranged boyfriend and the father of her unborn child attempted to break into her house, breaking down the door of her apartment. The pregnant women prevented a potentially tragic situation by being armed. (RELATED: Students Force University Of Virginia To End 21-Gun Salute On Veterans Day)

Despite the listed examples and many more, establishment media outlets have typically snarled at the notion of a good person with a gun acting to save lives. Susanna Lee of the international news outlet Quartz referred to a good guy with a gun as a “deadly American fantasy.” Alyssa Rosenberg of The Washington Post called the notion a “Hollywood’s most dangerous lie,” placing the blame for mass shootings at the foot of one of America’s most left-wing institutions.

“Elected officials should be ashamed of hiding their inaction behind this vapid slogan. The industry that’s profited off this image for decades should feel ashamed, too,” Rosenberg wrote. “The entertainment industry has played an enormous role in promoting the idea of the invulnerable action-hero cop, to the detriment of civilians and police officers.”

The ominous PBS documentary “Gunned Down: The Power of the NRA” decried the NRA’s influence in American politics, and ridiculed NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre for saying that good guys with a gun have the ability to prevent mass shootings.

“And he almost immediately goes right back to what they usually say, which is that the answer to this is more guns,” CBS News political correspondent and former Washington Post reporter Ed O’Keefe says in the documentary.

Despite this being the settled wisdom of the establishment media outlets, the examples listed above, and findings by the FBI that good guys with a gun can and often do prevent tragedies. The FBI published a study in 2017 of mass shootings that occurred in 2016 and 2017, and found 10 incidents where a good guy with a gun engaged the bad guy. Of the 10 incidents, eight were resolved successfully.

“Armed and unarmed citizens engaged the shooter in 10 incidents. They safely and successfully ended the shootings in eight of those incidents. Their selfless actions likely saved many lives. The enhanced threat posed by active shooters and the swiftness with which active shooter incidents unfold support the importance of preparation by law enforcement officers and citizens alike,” the report stated.

The media and the left may not believe that a good guy with a gun can prevent a tragedy, but there are countless examples and an FBI report that suggest otherwise. It will be fascinating to see if these inconvenient truths are given the time of day as states such as Virginia fervently debate gun control.",2.5,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333, CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery .

In a meeting with the Swiss charge d’affaires on Wednesday, Mohsen Baharvand, an assistant to Iran’s foreign minister, urged Switzerland to convey Iran’s protest to the US, and also tell them that Iraq is an independent country with freedom-seeking, independence-seeking, and honourable people.

“The US army has martyred at least 25 young members of the Iraqi nation and wounded scores of others without providing any evidence for their culpability,” Baharvand said.

“The Iraqi people would naturally show reaction to a country that has occupied their territory and is killing their youths. Americans have even bombed two areas in Syria at the same time. That shows they are seeking to achieve other goals, and are just looking for pretexts,” he added.

Baharvand said the American officials had better stop pinning the blame on others and levelling groundless accusations against the Islamic Republic.

The Swiss envoy was also told that Iran is not a hawkish country, but its hands are not tied when it comes to countering any threat and unwise move.

In that case, it will defend itself with full force.

“Instead of raising baseless accusations against others, the US government must learn how to speak to other nations and stop occupation,” the Swiss charge d’affaires was told.

Angered by US air raids that killed over two dozen fighters from Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) on Sunday, hundreds of protesters stormed its embassy compound in the high-security Green Zone on Tuesday, setting fires and chanting: “Death to America!” They also demanded the removal of American troops from Iraq.

Reacting to the attack, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday held Iran “fully responsible” for the incident on Twitter and added that the protesters “will be held fully responsible.”

In a separate statement, Trump later also warned that Tehran would “pay a very big price” after the attack.","The Swiss charge d’affaires was summoned on Wednesday over Washington’s accusations against Tehran and its stance on the latest developments in Iraq, according to the Iranian Foreign Ministry’s website.

During the meeting with the Swiss diplomat, an Iranian foreign minister’s assistant, Mohsen Baharvand, asked him to convey Iran’s strong protest to the US officials over their “warmongering statements” in violation of the United Nations Charter, the ministry said.

“He (the Swiss envoy) was reminded that Iran is not a country seeking war… but stands against any threat or any unreasonable act and defends itself with all its might,” according to the website.

US officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to accuse Iran of encouraging the protests underway in Iraq against US airstrikes on bases of Popular Mobilization Units PMU), also known as Hashd al-Sha'abi.

On Sunday, US forces conducted drone strikes on a number of Kata'ib Hezbollah bases in Iraq's western Anbar province, killing at least 28 individuals and leaving another 51 injured.

Kata'ib Hezbollah is part of Iraq's PMU.

Following the strikes, the Pentagon issued a statement saying that it had targeted three locations of the Iraqi fighters in Iraq and two in Syria in response to alleged attacks targeting American forces.

The incident led to a massive funeral ceremony for the Iraqi martyrs, followed by a huge rally by thousands of angry protesters who reached the US diplomatic mission in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, chanting ‘Death to America’ and burning US flags on Tuesday.

The protesters further held up signs calling for the US mission to be shut down and for the parliament to order US forces to leave Iraq.

Many protesters have set up tents, announcing plans for an indefinite sit-in until the embassy is closed and the ambassador expelled from the country.

Stadia was criticized for missing and appending “coming 2020” to so many core features at launch. Precisely six weeks old at the end of 2019, Google’s game-streaming platform will truly grow up this year. Here’s a look at everything that’s yet to come.

Wireless Stadia Controller for mobile, desktop

Even if what appears on the screen is streaming from a faraway server, having a wire from your phone or PC attached to a game controller is not very futuristic. The first-party Made by Google’s signature direct Wi-Fi connectivity is only available on the Chromecast Ultra.

While the best and most familiar gaming experience for the majority is in front of a large television, mobile and web are what truly emphasize that no console is required. Those two form factors extend AAA gaming outside the home, and that’s a first for general gamers. The Google Store listing for Stadia Premiere Edition explicitly states that extended availability is “coming in 2020.”

Feature parity

Mobile

Closely related to expanded wireless Stadia Controller support is a grab bag of features only found when playing with Chromecast Ultra. For example, screen/clip capture is not available through the controller on mobile (or web), while Android devices can only hear voice chats. There is no way to respond or even start parties on smartphones. Similarly, Assistant is only available on the streaming dongle, with achievements not available on mobile yet.

Most of those limitations are presumably related to the Stadia Controller not being able to communicate those actions over a cable. Regardless, it’s confusing for people expecting the same experience on whatever device they want to play with.

Web

Gameplay on Mac, Windows, and Linux fares better than Google’s mobile operating system. The biggest feature limitation is 1080 p-only gameplay that does not allow users to experience Stadia’s 4K promise. Another gripe is the lack of “Data usage and quality” or “Display” settings online, while viewing Captures are mobile only — and all platforms could benefit from basic sharing.

Support for more Android devices and iOS

Stadia is currently limited to the Pixel 2, Pixel 3, Pixel 3a, and Pixel 4 family of devices. Google’s mid-range phones make it evident that flagships are not required to run Stadia. Of course, what people are really asking for is iOS and — specifically — the iPad. Any tablet would be better suited for mobile gameplay than a phone.

Google noted during an AMA before launch that it wants “Stadia to run on every screen eventually.” It hopes to “start expanding to more devices next year.”

Android TV support

Thanks to a leaked conference presentation, we learned in September that “Stadia integration” is coming to Android TV with Android 11 in 2020. This would be in line with a push to bring the service to devices that people already own.

In-game Google Assistant

Speaking of Assistant, Google’s cross-device help tool currently has very limited capabilities on Stadia. The most useful game-related functionality is asking to launch a title. At GDC 2019, Google imagined Assistant being able to find video walkthroughs when you’re stuck.

This is likely a more gargantuan task than meets the eye. Fundamentally, Assistant has to be aware of what’s occurring in games. That presumably requires developers to create in-game markers, with YouTubers making similar markups.

YouTube

Streaming

Another ambitious integration is YouTube. But to start with, Google could allow for basic gameplay streaming. This is surprisingly missing for a service that the company touted as generating an extra feed that’s specifically for YouTube.

Interactive sharing

More broadly, there is an opportunity to leverage the large gaming community on Stadia by just having them join streaming creators with Crowd Connect. Also interesting would be State Play where people could share a specific scenario and let others replicate or beat a scenario.

LTE, cellular gameplay

Stadia requires an Ethernet or Wi-Fi connection, with LTE not explicitly supported today. That said, the workaround is just making a hotspot with your phone and connecting your laptop. Microsoft’s xCloud beta currently supports LTE networks, and Google could be looking to optimize.

Stadia Store improvements

At 26 titles with various editions, the Stadia Store badly needs search and not just curated sections. Meanwhile, pre-ordering has been hinted at, while “Family” functionality should extend beyond just parental controls. There should be the ability to share games even if only one user is allowed to play at a time.

However, the most important addition to the Stadia Store would be demos. The first aim is to let people actually test how the platform runs on their network for free, and would go a long way to address skepticism. Down the road, streaming Stadia demos could expose gamers to new technologies or concepts. The other reason is of course trying a title before buying.

Stadia Base and monthly Pro subscription

Joining Stadia is not as simple as you’d expect for a web service. A $129 buy-in is currently required with Google clearly wanting the first users to have everything they need to experience on a TV.

Stadia Base is expected to come in 2020 to let players just buy games outright without needing Stadia Pro. The $9.99 subscription provides 4K quality, a free game every month, and discounts. It’s a pretty good value, but most will make do with 1080p, especially to just try out how Stadia works for them.

That said, even more vital is some sort of demo experience that would truly showcase how accessing Stadia is as simple as clicking a link.

Ads in software are a great source of revenue for companies, but it’s usually something that users don’t appreciate. This week, Realme announced that it would be bringing ads to ColorOS following a year of massive growth in the Android market.

Nomad case for Pixel 3

Realme, for those unaware, is a popular Android smartphone maker, especially in India. We haven’t covered Realme much, but in 2019, the company managed 400% year over year growth which saw it take the #4 spot in India behind Xiaomi, Samsung, and Vivo. Part of that growth is thanks to Realme’s value on its smartphones which are usually priced lower than the comparable competition.

Going into 2020, Realme wants to “continue offering more surprises” by bringing “content recommendations” to its ColorOS skin over Android. Essentially, Realme is bringing ads to its software in order to help maintain a “healthy and sustainable business model” going forward.

This change will affect devices running ColorOS 6 and the ads on Realme devices will appear in two different places. The first is in the Phone Manager app while the second is on the Security Check page. The ads are enabled by default, but Realme users can disable them by going to Settings > Additional Settings > Content Recommendation and toggling the “feature” off.

Ironically, Realme made fun of Xiaomi earlier this year (via Android Authority) over ads that Xiaomi placed within MIUI, even showing it as a selling point of the Realme 3.

103,104,A Hate Crime Is A Hate Crime No Matter Who Commits It,The left’s constant victimhood olympics is a gift to anti-Semites,"There's no doubt Grafton Thomas committed a hate crime when he allegedly stabbed five people at a Hanukkah party in New York. He is an African American. There was a time when the two, a hate crime, and African American, were not only mutually exclusive but almost unthinkable. There was good reason. In the long vile, hideous history of racially motivated hate violence in America, African Americans have been the prime targets.

The legions of statutes, photos, and various exhibits that depict gruesome lynching scenes and mob violence against African Americans at the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Alabama is gory testimony to that. But even before Thomas welded his machete at the Hanukkah party in New York that had changed.

While Thomas's attack is a grotesque and extreme example of hate violence, it is hardly an aberration. More whites are the targets of racially motivated attacks by Blacks. True, some of the attacks against whites by Blacks are for their money and valuables. Others are revenge assaults by Blacks for real or imagined racial insults. It is equally true that most violent crimes against whites are committed by other whites, while most violent crimes against blacks are committed by other Blacks.

Yet even after discounting crimes that are hastily and erroneously tagged as racially motivated, many blacks do attack whites because they are white. Justice Department studies have shown that a measurable number of the hate crimes examined were committed against whites by Black attackers. The Southern Poverty Law Center which for decades has tracked hate violence in America notes that cases of Black-on-white violence has been more than an aberration in the last two decades.

More than a few ultra-conservative websites, loggers, and the usual motley collection of white supremacists and rightist extremist groups have jumped all over this and screamed long and loud that racial hate now comes with a Black face. This does several things. It puts the finger-point on Blacks as America's major hate mongers. It feeds into America's gun mania by igniting loud calls for fearful whites to arm and protect themselves from lawless Blacks. But most of all, it presents the false narrative that racially motivated hate violence is a grim product of a long bygone past, and that whatever hate violence remains is perpetuated by Blacks.

This lie has worked. Who better than Trump to prove it? He took much heat in November 2015, for his false, gross factually challenged, and deliberately inflammatory retweet of a favorite white nationalist talking point about Black on white crime. Said Trump, whites were in grave peril from being murdered by Blacks, and the stats supposedly proved that. The figures were quickly debunked. It didn't matter. The lie was out there, and countless numbers believed it.

Trump's racist bombast could get zero media and public traction if there weren't just enough white victims and, now as the attack on the Hanukkah party showed, Jewish victims of Black hate violence to make these fallacious claims seem plausible. That's stirred a kind of reverse prickliness on the part of many Blacks. The reaction has been either disbelief that Blacks can commit a hate crime. Or, there's the complaint that when Blacks do commit a hate crime and whites are the victims, the media blows it to the sky and federal hate crime charges are quickly slapped on the Black offender. The charge is there's a double standard in how the media and public perceives and reacts to Black violence against whites as opposed to white violence against Blacks. Thus, there is little outcry or condemnation of it by Blacks. Civil rights leaders and organizations, yes, but Blacks in general, no.

Worse, some Blacks quietly shrug off the violence with the bitter remark that whites have been killing Blacks for years and getting away with it, and that there has been no massive explosion of white outrage at the lax treatment of white killers.

The deafening silence by Blacks on this apparent racial outrage against whites will draw shouts from some that Blacks are hypocrites and have a double standard when victims are whites. They're not totally wrong. The victims of Thomas's rampage were innocents who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and were shot because they were white.

Blacks must mourn these murders as passionately as they do those of Black victims of white attacks and just as passionately call for the harshest punishment of the killer(s). The great strength of the civil rights movement was that it seized and maintained the moral high ground by never stooping to ape the violence of white racists.

The Thomas onslaught caused monumental pain and suffering to the victims' families and friends. It again dangerously heightens racial distrust and poisons racial attitudes. There must be no hesitation, pause, or equally bad silence in condemning these attacks. When Blacks say or do nothing about these attacks, it is taken by some as a tacit signal that Blacks put less value on white lives than on Black lives. There's only message in the wake of the stabbings. A hate crime is a hate crime no matter who commits it.

If you’re a New Yorker or a Jew or both, you’re asking why. Why has yet another African-American attacked Jews? Why has black-on-Jewish assault become a continuous feature of life in and around New York? Why now?

The answer: Because the country is seized by the politics of victimhood, and there’s nothing that self-pitying “victims” find easier than blaming Jews for their misery.

The names given to the bogeymen of today’s populism are all historical code words for Jews. On the populist right, this means the elite, the globalists and the media. On the populist left, it’s Wall Street, the wealthy and the 1 percent. If that isn’t enough, the left has also decided that Jews — a minority who make up 2.2 percent of the American population — are “hyper-white” and, in Marxist terms, actually part of the power structure that keeps minorities down.

It’s no secret that right-wing populism has facilitated a violent, sometimes deadly, rise in Jew-hatred, but it’s forbidden to draw similar conclusions about the populist left. At least in public. There are two reasons for this: First, pointing out the problem on the right is a means of attacking President Trump. Second, addressing the problem on the left would mean facing the outsize role that black Americans have played in recent attacks against Jews.

On the first point, it is not only wrong to blame Trump for right-wing anti-Semitism, it’s perverse. How anyone gets away with claiming that the president doesn’t condemn Jew-hatred is beyond me. He condemns it at every turn. He devoted an unprecedentedly large chunk of his last State of the Union address to denouncing anti-Semitism and vowing to fight it wherever it may arise.

Trump recently moved to crack down against anti-Semitism on college campuses (and was denounced for it as a racist by the left). For his commitment to fighting Jew-hatred and his unfaltering support of Israel, he has earned the enmity of far-right anti-Semites.

On the second point, the facts speak for themselves. Throughout 2019, African-Americans attacked Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn on a more-or-less weekly basis, and it barely ever made the mainstream news. It wasn’t until two members of the Black Hebrew Israelites shot up a kosher market in Jersey City in early December that the media was forced into acknowledging reality.

The left’s leading populists have fetishized the victim status of certain minorities, including African Americans. They have made slavery and its legacy the focal points of American life. They have determined, without evidence, that police are on a campaign to kill unarmed blacks. And they speak generally as if we have suddenly been transported to a pre-civil-rights-movement America.

What’s more, unlike Trump, some of the left’s leading populists have gone out of their way to steer their followers toward blaming the Jews. The stand-out figures here are Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Their public record of blaming Jewish money for corrupting American politics is so well-known that it needs no rehearsing here. And it has either been ignored or defended by the larger left. If you called either of them out on their anti-Semitism, you were charged with racism and misogyny. Omar so petrified Democratic leaders that they couldn’t even pass a House resolution condemning her blatant anti-Semitic remarks.

But the problem on the left goes beyond Omar and Tlaib. And it goes beyond the rest of the Squad, who engage in constant anti-Israel theatrics. It stretches to the identitarian populism of most of the 2020 Democratic candidates for president, to the liberal garment-rending over the defeat of the anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn, to the intersectional gobbledygook that divides college campuses by ethnicity, to the Women’s March activists who embrace Louis Farrakhan and down to the community level, where, for example, the NAACP’s Passaic branch posts Facebook rants blaming tainted water supplies on the Jews.

Historically, indulged victims have needed no encouragement in pointing their finger at Jews. Telling them that others are responsible for their woes has usually been enough to get them headed in that direction. But some on today’s left have given Jew-hatred an extra nudge. Their winks, dog-whistles and outright calumnies have served as a noxious propaganda campaign and led to a surge of minority anti-Semitism. With the attempted murders in Monsey, this can no longer be kept a secret, and maybe those who have facilitated it will begin to know a little shame.

But as we enter 2020, with no thought of defeat — we do so conscious that long before terms such as resilience and sustainable development were fashionable, we saw ourselves and we knew that we are a resilient people who for centuries have battled adversity of every kind, and we have always prevailed.

Our very history has been one of struggle but one of success!

It is against this backdrop that we can take a fresh look at the path we would wish to set for ourselves and our children, using a term that is no doubt familiar to us all.

It is my sincere wish that our approach to the advancement of our people in every country of Caribbean Community would be characterized by a level of clarity that is usually associated with 2020 vision.

For generations, the actions and the experiences of ordinary men and ordinary women of the Caribbean have left no doubt that they have always known what they have wanted for the inhabitants of these islands.

And we are no different today. In fact, many of us have demonstrated what true integration really means, in spite of the obstacles of bureaucracy that we sometimes confront in our leadership class as we go about our ordinary business.

But at the same time, we recognise that the regional integration movement is very much a relay race. Sometimes we are hard on ourselves, expecting to achieve overnight that which requires patience and careful nurturing over generations.

Our vision to better the lot of our people has remained constant — from the very early days of the Montego Bay Conference in 1947 on Closer Association of the British West Indian Colonies, to the West Indian Fédération of 1958 to 1962 most ably led by the founder of my own political party, the Right Excellent Sir Grantley Adams.

From the establishment of CARIFTA on December 15, 1965 – ten weeks after I was born – at Dickenson Bay in Antigua, to its transformation into the Caribbean Community, the institution we now know, the document signed on July 4, but coming into force on Emancipation Day, August 1, 1973 at Chaguaramas in Trinidad, or to the 1989 Grand Anse Declaration in Grenada that signaled our determination to remove the disadvantages of size and geography from our national development through the commitment to establish the Single Market and Single Economy.

Our process has therefore been one that has moved from generation to generation of committed Caribbean people, to the building of a regional integration movement that will allow us always to work to provide the best lives possible for our people.

Lest we be influenced by those who would only see a half empty glass, rather than one that is half full, may I remind us all that the European integration movement started on April 16, 1948 so as we enter the third decade of the 21st century they too are still working to perfect that union, despite having far more resources than we have ever had in the Caribbean.

I pray, therefore, that 2020 will strengthen us to run our leg of this regional integration relay race with confidence.

I pray that as leaders of the Caribbean Community we will work to give our people renewed confidence and inspiration to help us run this leg, while staying focused on achieving the next phase of critical progress.

And what is that next phase? We are duty bound to continue this journey across the Community whether as a collective of the whole or in twos and threes where we are gathered in a way that will:

Remove the obstacles to passport-free movement between our nations; Make it easier for Caribbean people to go and work where there are opportunities in the Community in a way that is hassle-free in the same way that we have done it for the movement of capital. In keeping with our own Errol Barrow’s vision, the reality of our people must not only be a lived reality but also a legal reality. The Caribbean Community must lead the world in shaping an environment within which migrants among us can live and work with dignity. After all, our modern settlement in the Caribbean has been nothing but that of a community of migrants; Truly advance the process of a single domestic space for transport and communications in the region by working to provide more affordable and reliable air and sea links between our countries and also to establish a single domestic rate for telecommunications and phone calls within CARICOM; Work with the private sector and the labour movement to provide further opportunities beyond transport and communications mentioned above, to food security, to opportunities in the blue economy or renewable energy and ICT for our people – opportunities for investment and for employment; Enable us as we face the climate crisis, to pool the funds of the region in order to be able to finance our own development trajectory for sustainable development so that we may adapt to the new realities of the climate crisis. This will require us coming up with innovative instruments that will better allow us to access the capital that we are not now accessing at a global level. Let us remember that those who help themselves will always be helped by others but we must help ourselves first by pooling our own resources.

My message, in essence, is that 2020 can and must provide the platform for a positive spirit of hope and optimism and a fierce determination to come together as Caribbean people to purposefully carry forward the transformation of our region into a space that truly values, nurtures, and provides concrete opportunities for every Caribbean man, woman and child to run our leg of this relay.

But our pathway toward a better life for our people will not open up the opportunities we seek if we focus only on ourselves and our region. While we look ahead, we must do so fully cognizant of the advances we are making in claiming our Atlantic destiny as a region as we reach out to our brothers and sisters on the African continent.

We have already started discussions at the highest levels on the African continent with people with whom many of us share a common ancestry and history and who, like us, recognize the imperative of mutual cooperation as we go into 2020.

CARICOM has accepted the offer of shared office space from the Government of Kenya in Nairobi. We need to open it urgently and advance our interests in the city that is indeed the home of the UN Environmental Programme and UN Habitat both of which deal with issues that are vital to our own development in the Caribbean Community.

Within the next six months, we will also work towards jointly hosting the first ever African Union-CARICOM Summit. We need to resolve as a region that we will not leave that gathering without laying the foundation for tangible progress in areas of direct air and sea access across the Atlantic, greater trade in goods and services, and more cultural exchanges between our regions.

In closing, I commend to people across our region the initiative we have embraced in Barbados. We have designated 2020 as the year in which we will work together to perfect our finer vision for all Barbadians, regardless of where in the world we live. We can only become better as Caribbean people if we hold to the maxim — Dare to dream; and always be determined to deliver.

But as we seek to use this year 2020 to perfect a finer vision for our island in Barbados, as we gather parish by parish, I want now to ask each of us as Caribbean people to do the same for where we want to go and who we want to be as Caribbean people for 2020 must be where we can perfect that fine vision.

All that is left for me to do is to wish you, each and every one, a blessed 2020 and to a greater and more powerful Caribbean Community!","America Ferrera has celebrated the new year by announcing she is expecting a second child with husband Ryan Piers Williams.

105,106,Article: Turning Space Into a War Zone -- U.S. Space Force Established,U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington,"President Trump has signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2020 that establishes a U.S. Space Force as the sixth branch of the U.S. armed forces -- despite the Outer Space Treaty designating space as a global commons to be used for peaceful purposes.

Reported Space News: ""Trump signed the NDAA flanked by top defense and military officials at a ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland."" https://spacenews.com/trump-signs-defense-bill-establishing-u-s-space-force-what-comes-next/ It quoted Trump saying: ""Today marks a landmark achievement as we officially inaugurate the newest branch or our military, the U.S. Space Force. This is very big and important moment.""

The Space News article quoted U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper saying at the signing December 20: ""Our reliance on space-based capabilities has grown dramatically and today outer space has evolved into a warfighting domain of its own. Maintaining American dominance in that domain is now the mission of the United States Space Force.""

Bruce Gagnon, coordinator of the Global Network Against Weapons & Nuclear Power in Space, headquartered in Maine, said of what happened: ""The words 'warfighting domain' and US 'dominance in space' indicate that the Pentagon is actively planning to fight a war in space. This misguided notion is probably the most dangerous and frightening development of my lifetime -- and I had thought the Cold War-era was bad. The idea that the U.S. thinks it can fight and 'win' a war in space is indeed the height of insanity.""

The U.S. Congress joining with the Trump administration ""to push forward with this 'US exceptionalism to the max' notion indicates just how much the aerospace industry has taken control of Washington,"" Gagnon, of Brunswick, Maine, continued.

""It is clear to me that what the Pentagon has long called 'the largest, and most expensive, industrial project in human history'Star Wars,' will drive our nation's economy over the cliff,"" said Gagnon. ""There will be rockets and weapons in space and more homeless across the nation than anyone could ever imagine. Yes, we should call it Pyramids to the Heavens. The aerospace industry is the contemporary version of the Pharaohs of Egypt and the taxpayers will be the slaves. But everything has an Achilles Heel and the enormous cost of Star Wars could just be it.""

He stated: ""It's more than the right time for the public to declare a resounding NO.""

The formation of a U.S. Space Force and the U.S. drive for ""American dominance"" of space will inevitably turn space into a war zone because other nations, China and Russia and then more, will respond in kind. There will be an arms race in space.

The landmark Outer Space Treaty of 1967 was put together by the U.S., the former Soviet Union, and the U.K., and since signed by most nations on Earth. It was spurred, as Craig Eisendrath, as a U.S. State Department officer involved in its creation, by the Soviet Union launching Sputnik, the first space satellite, as he noted in the 2001 TV documentary I wrote and narrate, ""Star Wars Returns."" It's online. https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4w2h7 Eisendrath said ""we sought to de-weaponize space before it got weaponized""to keep war out of space.""

The Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space, and although the Trump administration and U.S. military have been claiming a Space Force is necessary because of Russia and China moving into space militarily, in fact Russia and China -- and U.S. neighbor Canada -- have been leaders for decades in pushing for an expansion of the Outer Space Treaty. They have been advocating the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) treaty under which the placement of any weapons in space would be barred. The U.S.under both Republican and Democratic presidential administrationshas opposed the PAROS treaty and has effectively vetoed it at the United Nations. (I've been there to see this.)

""'Today is an historic moment for our nation as we launch the United States Space Force,'"" Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett told reporters Dec. 20,"" said the Space News article. ""The Space Force is the first new military service created since 1947, when the Air Force was born from the U.S. Army Air Corps,"" it continued .

""The Space Force authorization marks a huge political victory for Trump, who started championing the idea of a space service in early 2018 and directed the Pentagon in June 2018 to figure out a plan to make it happen,"" said Space News, quoting Barrett as saying: ""The president's vision has become a reality with overwhelming bipartisan and bicameral support from Congress."" Raymond: ""We do have a plan to rename the principal Air Force bases that house space units to be space bases.""

In a subsequent article, Space News reported that with the establishment of a U.S. Space Force, there is a plan to rename U.S. Air Force bases as U.S. Space Force bases. The piece said: ""Air Force installations that primarily do space work would be renamed Space Force bases. Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, for example, could become Peterson Space Force Base. Other candidates for re-designation include Colorado-based Schriever Air Force Base and Buckley Air Force Base, Patrick Air Force Base in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.""

The article quoted General John ""Jay"" Raymond, who has been commander of the U.S. Space Command and has become commander of the new U.S. Space Force, as saying: ""We do have a plan to rename the principal Air Force bases that house space units to be space bases."" https://spacenews.com/following-standup-of-u-s-space-force-air-force-bases-could-be-renamed-as-space-bases/?fbclid=IwAR06TsDxQAfTBHd8G2765Oiq_xQxL-3ofyWE8XzQ1tIPJfSr72UrSp9kMEo

In the U.S. House of Representatives, the vote for NDAA on December 11 was 377 to 48. Some 189 Republicans and 188 Democrats voted for it. Six Republican House members voted no along with 41 Democrats and one independent. The vote was reported to be a result of a trade-off for 12 weeks of paid parental leave for civilian federal employees. The New York Times' article on the vote said Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and advisor, was pivotal. ""It was Mr. Kushner who helped broker a deal to create the Space Force, a chief priority of the president's, in exchange for the paid parental leave, a measure championed by his wife, Ivanka Trump, also a senior advisor to the president,"" said The Times. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/us/politics/house-ndaa-space-force-leave.html

Cantwell: Cybersecurity adversaries become more sophisticated and more organized day by day

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, U.S. Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), the top Democrat on the committee, continued her fight for consumers as Congress considers federal data privacy legislation.

“When the dust settles after a data breach or a misuse of data, consumers are the ones who are left harmed or disillusioned,” said Cantwell.

Cantwell highlighted the onslaught of data breaches consumers have faced, including a recent data breach that left unprotected the addresses, full names, dates of birth, income, and marital status of more than 80 million US households.

“Consumers continue to be bombarded by threats to their privacy. Cybersecurity adversaries become more sophisticated and more organized day by day, and we really need to understand privacy on a continuum of data security. We need to take a more proactive approach to cybersecurity and make sure that we are continuing to protect consumers.”

Some reports have estimated that more than 1,200 data breaches exposed over 446.5 million records in the United States in 2018. Worldwide, data breaches compromised more than 4.5 billion data records in the first half of 2018 alone. And this year, the largest ever single public data breach by volume was discovered – it exposed more than 772 million unique emails and more than 21 million unique passwords.

In light of these ever-increasing cyber threats, transparency, consent and plain-language notices are simply not enough, Cantwell said in her remarks, while pushing for a greater focus on protection of people’s personal data.

“While the benefits of the online world are everywhere…so must be protections of personal information that is more than just a commodity. We need to make sure that the culture of monetizing our personal data at every twist and turn is countered with the protection of people’s personal data.”

At the first Commerce Committee hearing on privacy in the 116th Congress, Cantwell criticized efforts to pre-empt laws from states like California, which has adopted its own privacy protections, in any federal legislation that Congress may consider.

Senator Cantwell has long advocated for more stringent protections for the privacy of American consumers, including when she questioned the CEO of Equifax on data breaches, when she questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and when she urged President Trump to veto a resolution passed by Congress to undo consumer privacy regulations adopted by the FCC.

Here is VIDEO and AUDIO from Senator Cantwell’s opening statement at today’s hearing.

106,107,Top 10 of 2019: Most Popular Plenty of Horne Columns,Three straight years of falling crime rates — and yet Chicago has a long way to go,"Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee

In 2018 County Executive Chris Abele bought a 1920s lakefront mansion in Shorewood. In May, 2019, he announced plans to demolish the mansion. The Plenty of Horne story on this became the most popular one of the year. The column included other suburban news among its favored posts, including a review of the transit-unfriendly remodeling of Bayshore, a Glendale mall, and of a riverfront battle in the Village of River Hills.

Closer to home, a land purchase by Saint John’s on the Lake, the conversion of a Third Ward firehouse and memories of a nonagenarian South Side bartender were also popular with readers. A 2018 post wondered if a painting commissioned for the State of Wisconsin Executive Residence, and then evicted to the Milwaukee Public Library, would be returned to the governor’s mantle, and was answered in the affirmative in a March, 2019 column. A visit to Chicago for the 70th birthday party for former mayor John Norquist brought memories to many, including this columnist. A story from 2018 about the licensure of Rudy Giuliani, Esq. (or lack thereof) remained in the Top 10, and from the looks of things, might be back again in 2020.

I am grateful for all of the readers who have shown their support for Plenty of Horne and Urban Milwaukee in the past year, and look forward to serving you — and seeing you — in 2020.","As families across Chicago look ahead to 2020, we want to take a moment to reflect on how far this city has come over the past year.

On New Year’s Eve, Chicago brought 2019 to a close with a third consecutive year of historic, record-level crime reductions across the city, with robberies, burglaries and vehicle thefts at their lowest levels in more than 20 years. And with the lowest number of shootings since 2014 and murders since 2015, overall violent crime in neighborhoods across the city dropped to a four-year low.

Opinion

These gains are the result of a data-informed, collaborative strategy with Chicago’s police officers, community-based organizations and street outreach groups who have dedicated their lives to keeping this city and its residents safe.

But make no mistake, we are not taking a victory lap. Our work will not end until Chicago is the safest big city in the country.

And while the numbers are improving, we know that statistics are cold comfort to the victims of the grinding violence that continues to traumatize communities across our city.

More than 260 teenagers and children were shot last year alone, 35 of whom saw their lives cut short by a bullet. While these numbers are down from 2018, this is still a grim reminder of the horrors of gun violence.

Whether it’s a 7-year-old girl shot early on Christmas morning, a child wounded by gunfire while trick-or-treating on Halloween, or 13 people struck by bullets after gunmen opened fire at a memorial; for all the gains we’ve made, it’s moments like these that show how far we still have to go.

These heinous, unconscionable acts have no place in our city, and we can never give safe harbor to perpetrators of violence.

Communities are shattered and families suffer from the on-going trauma of devastating and relentless violence. Such violence is not normal. We cannot allow ourselves to grow numb to it.

Now, more than ever, our faith must overcome our fears, and residents must continue to take back their communities block by block, together.

Ending the tragedy of gun violence demands that we continue our work to build trust between our police department and the communities they serve.

Trust is the best public safety tool we have. It’s earned through officers being invested in improving the neighborhoods they serve — one block party, one softball game, one community barbecue at a time.

2020 will mark Chicago’s first full year under the federally-mandated consent decree to reform our police department and lay the foundation for accountability and transparency. Its ultimate success depends on our officers viewing it as an opportunity not an obstacle.

As chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, Charlie Beck led his city through its own consent decree, and worked to restore integrity to a department plagued by distrust and corruption. Now, as interim superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, he is laying the groundwork for our own road to reform and moving Chicago toward a policing model that relies on constitutional, compassionate and culturally fluent officers who carry a mindset of respect with them every day.

But our officers can’t do this alone. It takes an all-hands-on-deck effort. And they are being joined by violence interrupters, blocks clubs and faith groups that have immersed themselves into the fabric of neighborhoods under a singular mission to protect the city we all call home.

The violence we are facing is the result of years upon years of disinvestments in our South Side and West Side communities. It will take time to fix.

Whether it’s providing mentoring and group-based therapy to 400 teenagers at the highest risk of gun violence through our Summer for Change initiative; working with 30 neighborhood-based organizations to provide treatment services and job training to communities hit hardest by addiction and violence; or aligning an unprecedented $750 million in public, private and philanthropic investments into our South and West Side neighborhoods; the meaningful gains we make in public safety today started by investing in our people and neighborhoods and focusing on the root causes of gun violence.

In 2019, we drove down crime to a historic low and started to change the narrative in Chicago. And in 2020, we will change it even further together.

With a new police superintendent to lead CPD in its next chapter of reform, a first-of-its-kind Office of Public Safety Administration to modernize our public safety departments and a $11.5 million down payment in our violence reduction strategy — a 700% increase in funding compared to last year — we have already started building on this momentum.

There’s hard work ahead of us. But we are on a path to a safer tomorrow, and we will not turn back until all Chicagoans experience and feel the safety they deserve.

107,108,"UK Grooming Gangs: Nearly 19,000 Girls Sexually Exploited in a Year",Fourfold rise in migrants rescued in English Channel: authorities,"Pomidor Quixote

Daily Stormer

January 1, 2020

People should look at this as a kind of homework for the schools’ sexual education curricula.

Breitbart:

The scourge of sexual exploitation of children has reached “epidemic” levels in the United Kingdom, as nearly 19,000 children were sexually groomed over the past year. Local authorities have reported over 18,700 suspected victims of child sexual exploitation at the hands of grooming gangs between 2018-19, more than five times higher than the 3,300 reported cases just five years ago. Sammy Woodhouse, a victim of the Rotherham rapist Arshid Hussain, said that the authorities have not implemented meaningful changes in combatting the crisis.

It’s almost as if the authorities wanted this to happen.

“You hear this bullshit line, ‘lessons have been learned’, but they haven’t learned anything”, she told The Independent. “I still hear a lot about the authorities aren’t doing things as they should. It’s not very often I hear something good and for all different reasons – if the police won’t act on reports, people feel they’re not being listened to or supported properly, or information not being shared”, she added. “I’ve said for years that this country’s in epidemic when it comes to abuse and exploitation. Authorities claim it’s under control but it’s not”, Woodhouse concluded.

Considering that the number of victims continues to increase and that the authorities themselves are reporting the increase… yeah, it’s obviously not under control.

Lancashire was the locality hit the hardest last year, with a total of 624 suspected victims, followed by Birmingham with 490, 447 in Surrey, 414 in Bradford and 409 in Gloucestershire. Thousands of more cases of abuse have been discovered across the country over the past decade, especially as the scandals of predominantly Pakistani male child rape gangs have been exposed. The Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, said that the figures demonstrate that grooming “remains one of the largest forms of child abuse in the country”. “The government has singularly failed to tackle this issue head-on. Its approach has been piecemeal and underfunded”, she said.

In order to tackle this issue head-on, another issue has to be tackled head-on: immigration.

That would be racist though, so the government won’t do it.

In 2018, then Home Secretary, Sajid Javid launched an inquiry into the ethnic origins of members of grooming gangs in the UK. Speaking to the BBC in December, Javid determined that the majority of perpetrators were of Pakistani origin. “When it comes to gang-based child exploitation it is self-evident to anyone who cares to look that if you look at all the recent high-profile cases there is a high proportion of men that have Pakistani heritage”, Javid said. “There could be – I’m not saying that there are – there could be some cultural reasons from the communities that these men came from that could lead to this kind of behaviour”, he added.

What does he mean “self-evident”?

These men look like average Londoners with English heritage.

See?

Besides, we have to look at the bright side here and consider that if British teenagers weren’t being groomed, then the men there would leave the country and search for sex elsewhere, and there would be no one left to pay the pensions and stuff.

The Economy would suffer and it would be a total disaster.

Silent Guardian of The Economy

There’s just no other way.

If we want The Economy to prosper, we have to allow these hard-working men to groom our daughters.","LILLE, FRANCE - Over 2,300 migrants had to be rescued attempting to cross the English Channel in 2019, four times the number for 2018, local authorities in northern France said on Tuesday.



In total 261 cases of crossings or attempted crossings were recorded by the French and British authorities, mainly in small, often overloaded, inflatable boats, the Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea told AFP.



Some 2,358 people had to be rescued compared to 586 in 2018.



Over the past year, growing numbers of migrants from Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia have taken to the treacherous waters of the Channel in small fishing boats or inflatable dinghies.



Rights groups have linked the crossings to a police crackdown to prevent the establishment of migrant camps in Calais and other areas along the French coast.



At least four migrants died in 2019 attempting to make the dangerous crossing in the Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, with strong currents and icy waters.



A spokesman for the UK's Home Office said a Border Force cutter and two coastal patrol vessels were patrolling the Channel.



""There has also been a doubling of patrols on French beaches and drones, specialist vehicles and detection equipment have been deployed to stop small boats leaving French shores and arriving in the UK illegally.

108,109,LETTERS: Value of trees cannot be overstated – Peace Arch News,18 Movies Every Entrepreneur Should Watch,"Editor:

While we continue to bleed tree-canopy loss in our communities, it is clear that councils who continue to give the green light to large infrastructure projects simply do not understand what they are creating in terms of future damage to our communities.

I would like to remind them of the value of maintaining tree life on our streets and avenues, and within parks and wooded sections of our cities:

• Trees absorb the CO2 in the atmosphere and store the carbon while releasing oxygen back into the air;

• Trees absorb pollutants and gases in the air, including nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxides, ammonia and ozone;

• In one year, an acre of trees provide enough oxygen for 18 people to breathe;

• Trees provide shade and keep us cool in hot weather. They can reduce temperatures on streets and in cities by up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit, whereas concrete and asphalt are heat-trapping;

• Trees help us conserve energy by reducing the need for the use of air conditioning in houses where trees are present nearby;

• Trees conserve water by reducing evaporation of it by heat and by ensuring that water loss is minimized by absorbing rainfall through their root systems instead of losing it to runoff;

• Trees act like sponges and help remove pollutants from rainfall water before it reaches storm drains and bodies of water;

• Trees help reduce soil erosion and landslides with their root systems and reduce flood potential;

• Trees can reduce exposure to UVB rays from the sun by up to 50 per cent;

• Neighbourhoods and homes that are barren have been shown to have a greater incidence of violence in and out of the home than their greener counterparts. Trees and landscaping help to reduce the level of fear;

• Trees provide a home and a habitat for wildlife. Imagine how challenging it has become for bird life to find appropriate nesting sites to help raise the next generation of their species. Birds are being squeezed out of many communities due to a complete lack of nest-building sites;

• The beauty of a well-planted property and its surrounding street and neighbourhood can raise property values by as much as 15 per cent;

• Studies show that the more trees and landscaping a business district has, the more business will flow in.

• A tree-lined street will also slow traffic – enough to allow the drivers to look at the storefronts instead of whizzing by.

These are just some of the many reasons for us to preserve trees and make them a large part of our communities, instead of clear-cutting huge swaths of them for what is promoted as ‘affordable housing’ for our growing communities and instead becomes yet another money-maker for a developer who cares little about the frivolous topic of tree preservation in the community.

Trees have communities, too, and communicate with each other to help them preserve and care for themselves through transportation of enzymes through their root systems.

If trees could talk, they would tell us that by removing them in the vast numbers that we continue to do, they are no longer able to help protect us from the future that awaits us in a world bereft of trees.

Wake up, community councils, and smell the coffee before the only thing we will be smelling is the slow burn of our communities from the ravages of our rapidly overheated climate. Stop the carnage before Mother Nature turns her back on us completely.

109,110,Bringing in a fresh decade: A 2020 lookahead for Michigan,2020 Outlook: Seven state issues to watch over 7 months,"Share This Story Tweet Share Share Pin Email

The Roaring '20s are upon us again, but it's a different sort of sound as a fresh decade dawns in Michigan.

It's the roar of construction equipment in downtown Detroit. The rumble of Jeep Grand Cherokees at FCA's Mack Avenue engine plant. The howl of Detroit Lions fans as the beleaguered franchise tries to figure out what's been going wrong for the past few generations.

OK, there's nothing new about that last one. But the team fired four assistant coaches and the strength and conditioning staff Tuesday, so maybe there's progress even with the same old head coach and general manager.

Elsewhere, it's a new day.

The auto show will be pushed back into warmer days. A dramatic new tower on the old Hudson's site will continue going up, while a dreary Joe Louis Arena should finish coming down.

Two more priests could face charges in a continuing clergy abuse scandal, and the Novi man moldering in a Russian prison should soon come to trial.

Criminal justice reform is on the docket, and so is political redistricting. There will be a new garden on Belle Isle and a new movie about Aretha Franklin.

And, finally, the damned roads will be fixed. Or not.

We might need to check back on that one in 10 years when we welcome the Thundering '30s. But here's a look at what's almost surely coming in 2020:

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer presents her fiscal year 2020 budget proposal to lawmakers during a joint meeting of the House and Senate appropriations committees in the Senate Hearing Room at the state capitol in Lansing, March 5, 2019.

Road funding, criminal justice reform talks to resume

January is likely to kick off a Take 2 of the road funding debate in Lansing as Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer presents a new plan to fix and fund Michigan’s crumbling infrastructure. The GOP-led Legislature panned Whitmer’s plan for a 45-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase last year, setting off weeks of debate, stalemate and then massive vetoes in the state budget that were only restored in mid-December. It remains to be seen whether the governor and Legislature can reach consensus on a new plan.

Lawmakers are expected to continue efforts to reform Michigan’s criminal justice system, and a fight might be brewing over tax dollars diverted for the state’s contentious economic development programs. Several incentive programs are on the chopping block as is future funding for the popular Pure Michigan tourism campaign, as lawmakers debate whether the state should be funding the programs.

The 2020 election is expected to cast a long shadow over the work of government as presidential candidates vie for the support of Michigan voters and a large swath of state lawmakers and federal officials compete for re-election.

In the midst of election chaos, the Secretary of State’s office also will be moving forward with the selection of commissioners for the new Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission who will redraw voting boundaries for 2022.

Michigan a target in presidential politics

Many believe the road to the Oval Office will go through Michigan in 2020. The state, seen as a key battleground, will first weigh in on March 10, when the state holds its presidential primary.

But just nine days into the new year, President Donald Trump will have his first rally of 2020 down the road in Toledo, potentially coinciding with the beginnings of his Senate impeachment trial.

Political experts say the president is trying to capitalize on two swing states in one stop: Ohio and Michigan. Ohio, once an extremely competitive state, has trended more Republican in recent years, with Trump winning by an 8 percentage point margin there in 2016. But Trump won Michigan that year by just 10,704 votes, his closest margin of victory.

Trump, along with Vice President Mike Pence, recently visited Michigan for a rally in Battle Creek on Dec. 18 — the same day the U.S. House voted in favor of two articles of impeachment against the president.

The Mitten State will again be in the national spotlight on Oct. 15, when the University of Michigan will host the second round of presidential debates at Crisler Center, just weeks before the November election.

AG expected to weigh in on clergy abuse, Flint Water Crisis

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is expected to announce charges against two additional priests shortly after New Year’s in relation to a clergy abuse investigation that generated charges against seven priests in 2019. Nessel also is expected to announce a lawsuit related to chemical contamination in Michigan’s drinking water.

Whitmer also has said she expects Nessel to make announcements in early 2020 regarding the criminal investigation into the Flint Water Crisis. The attorney general is likely to run up against the statute of limitations for several potential charges in Flint in April, which will mark the six-year anniversary of the moment the city switched its water source from Detroit's water system to the Flint River.

Auto show to make summer debut

The Detroit auto show will see a big change in 2020. Show organizers officially announced in 2019 that the 2020 show would take place in June after decades as a winter staple in downtown Detroit. Show organizers plan to expand the show outside of TCF Center downtown to include outdoor events, and add to the annual Charity Preview event with an outpost in Hart Plaza. Showrunners and automakers expect the move to warmer months would add new experiences for consumers attending the annual event.

Chrysler plant to open, electrification ramps up

Detroit’s first new assembly plant in nearly 30 years is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2020. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s reconfigured and expanded Mack Avenue Engine Complex will produce the new Jeep Grand Cherokee and new full-size, three-row Jeep SUVs along with plug-in hybrids versions. Nearby, General Motors Co.’s Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant will idle starting in February as the plant is retooled to build electric pickup trucks and vans.

Ford Motor Co. also is upping its electrification efforts with the Ford Mustang Mach-E SUV, which is expected to become available in the fall, and the new F-150 pickup, which will offer a hybrid version in 2020 with a fully electric model to follow. Plymouth-based Rivian could begin delivering its electric pickup and SUV in late 2020.

Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler and French automaker Groupe PSA of the Peugeot brand will be working toward obtaining regulatory and shareholder approval to merge and create the world’s fourth-largest automaker. The combination, however, could take until early 2021 to close.

Third-grade students entering Michigan's K-12 public schools this fall will be subject to retention under the state's third-grade reading law if they are not reading at grade level on the state assessment in 2020.

Third-grade reading law takes effect

Michigan's controversial third-grade reading law allows educators to retain struggling third-graders beginning this spring.

The law, adopted in 2016, stops third-grade students from moving to the fourth grade —with some exemptions — if they read a grade level behind on the state's English Language Arts assessment, which measures reading, writing, listening and language.

However, Michigan will use a scoring system to make third-grade retention decisions that could promote thousands of students who still need additional reading help.

In 2019, the Michigan Department of Education approved a set of cut scores — selected points on a test's score scale — for third-graders taking the M-STEP in 2020 that will be used to make decisions for retentions.

Only 5% of third-grade students would have been held back under the new scoring system had it been applied to 2019 scores. That figure is in dramatic contrast to the 54.9% of third graders — or 55,336 students — scored less than proficient on the ELA test.

A decision in Detroit literacy battle

A ruling is expected early this year in a historic case over whether Detroit school children can access literacy amid deplorable conditions in their schools and whether the state of Michigan denied their rights when it ran the district.

A three-judge panel heard oral arguments in October in the 2016 case in which seven Detroit students allege a lack of books, classrooms without teachers, poor building conditions and extreme temperatures deprived them access to literacy in their public schools.

A lawyer for the state of Michigan, however, argued decreased student enrollment triggered a loss of financial resources to Detroit schools and that the state is not responsible for what happened in the district during its two decades of oversight.

Judges Eric L. Clay, Jane Branstetter Stranch and Eric E. Murphy spent more than an hour hearing from attorneys from both sides and asking questions about the case.

The class-action lawsuit, which is seen as an unprecedented attempt to establish that literacy is a U.S. constitutional right under the 14th Amendment, is being closely watched by education, legal and civil rights experts with some saying it could make its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Novi man accused of espionage awaits trial in Russia

A trial is expected in early 2020 for a Novi man who has spent more than a year in a Russian prison on spying charges. Paul Whelan, 49, was arrested Dec. 28, 2018, in a Moscow hotel room and charged with espionage. His family has said he was in Russia for a friend’s wedding.

During a Christmas Eve detention hearing, a Moscow court ordered Whelan to remain behind bars. Russian authorities won't consider releasing him until after his trial, which could be held in March, at the earliest, according to his lawyers. Whelan's defense team has argued he was framed and had no knowledge of the classified data on a flash drive he was handed as part of the alleged setup.

In October, the U.S. House unanimously approved a resolution urging Russia to produce “credible” evidence against Whelan or “immediately” release him. Whelan's employer, automotive parts supplier BorgWarner, recently confirmed that his job in Michigan has been eliminated. Whelan's family and the U.S. Embassy in Moscow have raised concerns about his declining health due to a hernia, as well as his treatment and isolation by authorities in Russia.

Young Tigers try to earn stripes

The Detroit Tigers say they’ve torn it all down. Now, we might this season get a chance to see what they’re building. Trades over the last three years have gutted the major-league roster, and it’s shown, as the Tigers have averaged 103 losses during that span. Those trades — as well as high first-round draft picks, thanks to the Tigers’ tailspin — have helped reseed a farm system left relatively barren as Detroit pushed for championships earlier in the decade.

That system could bear plenty of fruit in 2020. Of the Tigers' top 10 prospects, according to MLB Pipeline, seven are projected by the site to reach Comerica Park at some point next season, with an eighth (catcher Jake Rogers) having debuted last season. That includes top prospect and former No. 1 overall draft pick, right-hander Casey Mize. Tigers general manager Al Avila also brought in solid if not unspectacular free agents in second baseman Jonathan Schoop and first baseman C.J. Cron to add pop to a lineup that last season was sorely lacking.

The 2020 Tigers won’t be ready to contend in the American League Central, to be sure, and very likely won’t even be ready to flirt with .500, but they could be better than last season’s 114-loss edition, giving fans a little hope for the present, and the future.

Plans for the $830 million Monroe Blocks project in downtown Detroit, seen in a courtyard view in this rendering, include more than an acre of open space.

Developments to progress downtown

For downtown development, 2020 will be a year of waiting for key details on several of the most ambitious real estate plans in the central business district.

Another question is the status of real estate mogul Dan Gilbert, who has been recuperating since he suffered a stroke in May, and the future structure of his Bedrock development group.

Construction of the estimated $1 billion Hudson's project — a ""city within a city"" as once described by Bedrock officials — will keep going in 2020. Completion date is 2023. In 2020, it's possible the developer will decide whether the project will include the city's tallest building.

At another Bedrock development, construction work of the estimated $830 million Monroe Blocks project, was slowed in 2019. More updates are expected in 2020.

Joe Louis Arena will become history in 2020; its demolition will be completed. What happens to the riverfront property is unclear. In fall 2019, Detroit-based Sterling Group said it wanted to buy the former arena and adjacent parking garage for $14.1 million. Under the proposed deal, the group may take up to five years to figure out what to do with the property.

Sometime in the early to middle of 2020, more specifics should be unveiled on the estimated $750 million plan for the University of Michigan's ""Detroit Center for Innovation."" The development planned for at ""failed jail"" site on the edge of Greektown. The development would be anchored by the $300 million research and graduate education building for UM students.

A revised blight bond plan

A new proposal to wipe out blight is anticipated from Detroit's administration in 2020 after City Council in November rejected Mayor Mike Duggan's plan to put a $250 million bond before voters to fund it.

The council's 6-3 vote against putting a 30-year bond before voters in March left the future path for tearing down tens of thousands of abandoned homes up in the air. The vote came as Detroit's auditor general released a critical report of city-funded demolition work, citing unreliable data and documentation.

Duggan has said he respected the council's decision and vowed to forge ahead on a plan that both sides can agree on.

Detroit has brought down nearly 20,000 houses since 2014, primarily with federally funds. But the program fell under scrutiny over bidding concerns and soaring costs and has since become the subject of local, state and federal reviews and investigations.

Michigan, Michigan State try to shake funk

The Michigan and Michigan State football programs will enter the 2020 season coming off the same-old, same-old. The Wolverines still haven’t reached a Big Ten title game under Jim Harbaugh and still can’t beat archrival Ohio State. The Spartans, meanwhile, still appear mired in mediocrity, coming off another seven-win season.

The program’s relative shortcomings fall on the shoulders of their coaches. Harbaugh returned to his old stomping grounds five years ago, tasked with helping the Wolverines regain a foothold with their rivals and the national landscape. And, while Harbaugh appears to have the upper hand on Michigan State, the drought against Ohio State (dating to 2011) and in the Big Ten (dating to 2004) persist. MSU head coach Mark Dantonio, on the other hand, has won Big Ten titles (three) but is 27-24 in the last four seasons while wading through plenty of off-the-field controversy, fueling talk of his future in East Lansing. Will 2020 be the season Dantonio finally returns, and will it be the season Harbaugh finally arrives?

The Lions and quarterback Matthew Stafford are 3-5-1, and appear to be headed to another season without a playoff appearance.

Decision time for Lions?

It just might be now or never for Lions general manager Bob Quinn and head coach Matt Patricia. Detroit’s 3-12-1 season — capped by a nine-game losing streak — has the spotlight squarely on the duo. Owner Martha Ford already has said Quinn and Patricia will be back in 2020, but expectations are clear: “We expect to be a playoff contender, and those are our expectations, which we’ve expressed to both Bob and to Matt,” she said in December.

The Lions — 9-22-1 in two seasons under Patricia — will be armed with the No. 3 overall pick in next April’s NFL Draft. They were in just about every game this season, holding leads in 14 of 16 games, despite a roster ravaged by injuries. Still, a turnaround will be a tall task for a franchise that hasn’t won a division title since 1994, and hasn’t won a playoff game since 1991.

New downtown, suburban eateries

When it comes to new restaurants in 2020, Detroit will continue to open its arms to a range of styles and cuisines from some renowned chefs. Two of the most anticipated set to open their doors in the new year are Freya and Dragonfly in the city’s Milwaukee Junction neighborhood. Chartreuse Kitchen and Cocktails owner Sandy Levine and chef Doug Hewitt are planning a dual concept with a chef-driven tasting menu at Freya, while Dragonfly will be a more casual space with an interesting bar including low-alcohol and no-alcohol cocktails.

There will also be a few big expansions — the famed Bucharest Grill will opens its first suburban location in Royal Oak’s Woodward Corners development — and some notable re-openings. Founders Brewing Company, which shut down at the end of 2019 after weeks of controversy stemming from a racial discrimination lawsuit filed by an ex-employee, is expected to reopen its Detroit taproom in early 2020.

On the movie front, look for some big follow-ups from some beloved franchises in the new year. “Wonder Woman 1984” and “Top Gun: Maverick” will both be released in June and are likely to sweep up at the box office. In May, Marvel’s “Black Widow” hits the big screen. “Respect,” the Aretha Franklin biopic starring Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson, will hit theaters on Oct. 9.

Dutch garden designer to transform Belle Isle

For those who love gardening, one big development will start to take root in Detroit in 2020: the first plantings for the highly anticipated Oudolf Garden Detroit on Belle Isle. Designed by world-renowned Dutch garden designer Piet Oudolf, the garden in front of the Nancy Brown Peace Carillon Tower was supposed to have its first major planting in fall 2019, but it had to be pushed back because of high water levels. The first planting will now likely happen in 2020 and is expected to draw volunteers from all over the world.","BOSTON — There are 213 days between New Year's Day and July 31, the final day for formal legislating in 2020. In that time, Massachusetts lawmakers hope to tackle what's left on their 2019-2020 session to-do lists, in addition to whatever else crops up unexpectedly as the session wears on.

The House and Senate took care of some items on the agendas that Democratic leaders sketched out last winter (Gov. Charlie Baker, too), but a number of heady issues remain unaddressed with seven months until the real work ends and campaign season really picks up.

Seven months from the finish line, here's a look at seven major issues to watch during the second half of the 191st General Court, which officially kicks off with light sessions on New Year's Day morning. Whether or not the Legislature makes significant progress on these topics, they will be key factors in the final analysis of the two-year session's accomplishments:

1) Transportation Revenue

All eyes are on the House in the new year as members prepare to take up a transportation revenue debate they delayed from the fall.

Key lawmakers have hinted an increase in the state's 24-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax will likely be a part of the package, but other proposals from higher fees on ride-hailing services to expanded roadway tolling may also be included in the bill. Any increase to the gas tax would be the first in Massachusetts since 2013. That history will hang over the next round of action: lawmakers raised the tax 3 cents and indexed it to increase alongside inflation, but voters repealed the latter half through a ballot question one year later.

While the House prepares for the debate — no bill has been unveiled yet, but Speaker Robert DeLeo said he is aiming for a vote in January — Senate leaders have not shown their hand.

President Karen Spilka has not yet committed to taking up the topic of transportation revenues in 2020, and the upper chamber's Transportation Committee chair, Sen. Joseph Boncore, said he expects any consideration to come after an informal transportation working group finishes its work at an undetermined time.

Gov. Charlie Baker, meanwhile, has already outlined his opposition to any gas tax increase and to congestion pricing, a strategy of altering roadway tolls at different times of day that many transportation advocates back. Pressure has been growing on lawmakers to address the state's wide-ranging transportation needs, particularly after a string of developments in 2019. The Baker administration's study on roadway congestion concluded that already-bad traffic conditions are getting worse.

A June derailment on the Red Line damaged aging MBTA infrastructure and created months of commuter headaches. An outside panel tapped in the wake of that incident concluded that T leaders have not prioritized safety culture, partly because of an overemphasis on reducing a repeated operating budget deficit while also pursuing capital investment. With Baker asserting the state already has enough revenue to tackle transportation needs, Democrats face pressure to work across branches to make sure they have the votes to overcome any vetoes, as well as the challenge of coming up with a plan that the electorate supports and which won't come back to haunt lawmakers when their names are up for re-election in November.

2) Climate Change

Eighty-one state lawmakers rang in 2019 by resolving to pursue a suite of climate policies, including moving the state to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The year brought youth climate strikes and clean energy pushes from municipal and business leaders but not, ultimately, completed climate legislation. The Senate is eyeing action in early 2020 on a bill that its Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy Committee chairman, Sen. Michael Barrett, has suggested will address clean energy along with emissions from vehicles and buildings.

Sen. Marc Pacheco, who chairs the Senate Committee on Global Warming and Climate Change, has been beating the drum for action in that branch.

The House, which passed a $1.3 billion borrowing bill in July to support municipal resiliency and adaptation projects, hasn't indicated if its members and leadership plan to embark on other efforts to produce and pass major climate legislation. The House's so-called GreenWorks bill, a priority of Speaker DeLeo's, has been sitting since its unanimous passage before the Senate Bonding Committee, chaired by Sen. Michael Moore of Millbury.

If a climate debate occurs in 2020, it will take place as South Shore residents and many elected officials continue to oppose the construction of a natural gas compressor station in Weymouth and as Massachusetts works with other states to build a regional cap-and-invest program aimed at cutting transportation emissions. The debate at the State House over actions that can be taken mostly within the state's borders comes amidst reports of progress, and setbacks, in the global effort to reduce emissions that scientists say are fueling climate change and rising sea levels.

3) Housing

In November 2018, eight months after the Housing Committee first endorsed Gov. Baker's proposal to lower the local voting threshold for zoning changes, its co-chair Rep. Kevin Honan said the bill would come up ""early in the next session.""

A full year came and went with no action to advance Baker's bill — or any other major housing production legislation — until the committee again favorably recommended it as part of a mid-December 2019 package.

As 2020 arrives, the push for action on housing now shifts to the two Ways and Means Committees and the Democrats that control them. The housing market in Massachusetts remains strained even after a $1.8 billion housing bond bill enacted in 2018, with the median home sale price up to $400,000 through October and report after report identifying a need for tens of thousands more units than the state currently has to offer.

Baker's bill is not the only tool lawmakers can consider to address the challenge: the Housing Committee also advanced legislation to establish a statewide target of 427,000 new housing units by 2040, to require multi-family housing by right in MBTA communities, to increase residential density and more.

In late January, the committee also plans to hear testimony on a push to revive local options for rent control, which was in place in three communities until a landlord-backed statewide ballot question banned the practice in 1994.

""The housing crisis has moved into the middle class and is creeping up beyond the middle class,"" Rep. Nika Elugardo warned at an October rally in favor of her tenant protection legislation. ""Now that so-called 'everyday people' are experiencing the pain of the housing crisis, people are beginning to question how we do business around here.""

4) Health Care

After whiffing on a major health care reform last session, lawmakers have been slow to move on the renewed attempt they promised — and there are no indications that the House, Senate and governor are even on the same page when it comes to health care. Gov. Baker rolled out his plan to address costs and quality in October, but the Democrats who control the Legislature gave it a mostly cool reception.

Rep. Jennifer Benson, chair of the Health Care Financing Committee, had been leading the House's latest attempt to rein in health care costs and stabilize the marketplace, but she just announced she's got a new job and will be resigning in early January. Speaker DeLeo hasn't indicated who his new health care point person will be, or whether the House intends to make health care a central part of its work over the next few months. The Senate's plan, while not crystal clear, is a bit more evident.

Senate President Spilka said in October that senators had been working ""for months now"" to craft health care legislation, with Health Care Financing chair Sen. Cindy Friedman and Mental Health, Substance Use and Recovery chair Sen. Julian Cyr leading the effort. The Senate already passed a bill dealing specifically with prescription drug prices, and Spilka has suggested that her branch will address the issue in pieces rather than with one comprehensive bill, a strategy that could complicate things with the House.

""I don't think any one bill can do it all,"" she said in October. Asked about the Senate's timeline for a health care bill, Spilka said, ""when it's ready ... and we will see if we do it in parts or in whole.""

5) Sports Betting/Gaming

At one point after the U.S. Supreme Court granted states the right to legalize sports betting, Massachusetts looked like it could be among the early adopters.

The state's casinos, which aren't quite living up to their revenue projections, are eager for a new way to attract gamblers and Bay State sharps are looking forward to placing a bet without having to drive across state lines. But as other states raced forward — New Hampshire this week joined Rhode Island in accepting wagers — the issue has moved to the back burner on Beacon Hill.

Led by Sen. Eric Lesser and Rep. Ann-Margaret Ferrante, the Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technology has been weighing the myriad issues that could come with a further expansion of gambling in Massachusetts.

""It is an issue that has potentially broad social consequences, so it has to be done deliberately and properly,"" Lesser told the News Service in December.

On top of the sports betting-specific questions the committee must answer — how should wagers or winnings be taxed? Should college sports be open to betting? How accessible should betting platforms be? — lawmakers have previously suggested they might address a more comprehensive scope of the gaming universe, including sports betting, daily fantasy sports and other forms of gaming and wagering, with legislation in the spring of 2020.

Gov. Baker, who filed his own sports betting bill in January 2019 in hopes that people could bet by the start of the NFL season, has said he doesn't anticipate much from the Legislature until the session is nearly complete. ""The session ends in July, but I would be very surprised if it got done before that,"" he said in October on WEEI.

6) Budgeting/Education Bill Implementation

Gov. Baker has until Jan. 22 to file his fiscal 2021 budget, a spending plan that will incorporate a newly lowered income tax rate of 5 percent.

Next year's budget will be the first to feature the substantial new spending called for under the new education funding law, and advocates' eyes will be on how well the governor and lawmakers, especially Ways and Means chairs Sen. Michael Rodrigues and Rep. Aaron Michlewitz, can live up to the $1.5 billion, seven-year commitment without carving up other budget priorities.

The law has no dedicated revenue source. Baker has characterized the investment as ""a stretch on a $40 billion budget,"" but ""not that big a stretch"" on an incremental basis. ""I certainly think what this means for us and for the Legislature on a go-forward basis, this is going to have to be sort of first-in when we make decisions about what the budget looks like,"" he said in November.

With revenue growth projected to be much slower than in recent years, pouring money into K-12 education could squeeze other priorities.

A tax revenue estimate developed by Michlewitz, Rodrigues and the administration is due by Jan. 15 and will shed light on how much the budget chiefs expect the fiscal picture to tighten in 2020. Flush with cash the past two years, the Massachusetts Legislature has still been the last in the country to finalize an annual budget, and a dispute this fall over a bill to allocate the fiscal 2019 surplus dragged for months.

It remains to be seen how Michlewitz and Rodrigues will lead in a slowdown, but Rodrigues said in December he's confident the state will have enough money to meet its needs. ""It's still growth,"" he said. ""I've been around long enough that I've been here when there's been shrinkage, and we're not moving in that direction.""

7) Jobs Bill

It's an even-numbered year, so chances are good that legislators will tackle an economic development/job creation bill before turning their attention to their re-election campaigns.

In mid-December, Gov. Baker unveiled and signed his administration's updated economic development plan and laid the groundwork for an economic development borrowing bill worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

""We'll file it shortly after the beginning of the new year,"" Baker said Dec. 13. ""Our hope is that we get an early hearing and ... they will pass something that looks like the legislation that will enable the implementation of this plan.""

Once a bill is filed, the next steps will likely be up to the Economic Development Committee and co-chairs Ferrante and Lesser, each of whom has issued a statement reflecting their interest in passing a bill. With unemployment below 3 percent, the Massachusetts economy contracted in the third quarter largely due to constraints on the labor force that are holding back growth, economists said.

Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito put it this way: ""We need to be a little selfish about the talent that we have here. We want to keep it here.""

The Baker administration signals in its plan that it intends to focus on the cost of doing business over the next three years, a message that the business community will welcome but which could run into obstacles in the Legislature. The plan also calls for steps to build on the growth in life sciences, advanced manufacturing, defense, and health care sectors and ""aims to leverage emerging sectors like artificial intelligence and robotics.""",2.333333333333333,3.0,1.3333333333333333,3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,2.333333333333333,2.0, The Detroit Lions fired four assistant coaches and the strength and conditioning staff Tuesday .

This government will set out a moderate Aristocracy: it is at present impossible to foresee whether it will in its operation produce a Monarchy, or a corrupt tyrannical --Aristocracy; it will most probably vibrate some years between the two, and then terminate in the one or the other ... George Mason's Objections to the Proposed Federal Constitution, June 18, 1788.

We the ""people"" now have the opportunity and the duty to prove Mr. Mason wrong. An impartial presidential impeachment trial now might well lead us toward a more honest, responsive body of civil officers and possibly even a less militaristic foreign policy. This is the first of a series of articles dealing with the flaws in our present impeachment trial system and the actions we might take to improve it before it is next called into use. In considering our present duty regarding impeachment, we can benefit from the words of James Madison, sometimes called the ""Father"" of our Constitution. He wrote on Oct. 15, 1788 (thirteen months into ratification) ""The great desiderata on a Court of Impeachment are 1. Impartiality, 2. Respectability (credibility): the first in order to a right the second in order to a satisfactory decision... James Madison, Observations on Jefferson's Draft of a Constitution for Virginia

This article first looks at democracy through the words of a philosopher. Next it quotes three prominent framers on impeachment. Then it comments on the political nature of our two presidential impeachment trials. Finally, it suggests the use of The Senate Impeachment Rules as the means of securing an impartial trial in 2020. Subsequent articles will suggest specific changes in the Senate Rules'

A Philosopher's Comment on Democracy

The 17th C. French Philosopher (and mentor to James Madison) Baron Charles de Montesquieu believed that the democratic form of government has an ""Inherent"" weakness in that it gives to its people the final power over their government (on ""parchment""), but fails to give them an effective way to control their civil officers. According to de Montesquieu, Kings control their civil officers by rewarding loyalty with titles. Dictators control theirs by punishing disloyalty with death. Perhaps the Framers of our democracy intended to put us, the people, in the places of kings and dictators. Instead, however, they gave us abstractions and ""parchment."" The people of democracies have their power in name only. The coming impeachment trial gives us another opportunity to devise a remedy to what de Montesquieu called democracy's ""inherent weakness:"" the great difficulty of creating a body of honest civil officers dedicated to our (the people's), even more than their own, best interests.

Hamilton on Impeachment

Hamilton submitted a statement of ""principles"" on Monday, June 18, 1787 (about three weeks after the Convention began). It read, in part, ""The Governour, Senators and all officers of the United States to be liable to impeachment for mal and corrupt conduct and, upon conviction, to be removed from office and disqualified for holding any office of trust or profit - - - all impeachments to be tried by a court to consist of the Chief . . . or Judge of the superior Court of Law of each State. Between June and September, he changed his mind about the judiciary. During the last few days of the Convention, he proposed (and secured approval of) the Senate as the trier of impeachments. During the ratification period, Hamilton published Federalist 65 and 66 supporting the Senate as the trier of impeachments.

Madison on Impeachment

Madison quoted de Montesquieu in Federalist No. 47 and elsewhere. He evidently took de Montesquieu's warnings seriously when the Baron wrote about (1) the dangers of mixing the powers of government and (2) the ""inherent"" weakness of democracies. He must have regarded Hamilton's insistence on the Senate as the trier of impeachments as a double blunder. It both violated the separation of powers principle and missed an opportunity to strengthen the impeachment provisions in response to de Montesquieu's criticism of democracies. Madison opposed Senate impeachment trials from the first to the last days of the Convention. James Madison's Notes of the Constitutional Convention for Sept. 8 (The Convention ended on Sept.16th) read, in part. ""Mr. Madison objected to a trial of the President by the Senate, especially as he was to be impeached by the other branch of the legislature . . . He would prefer the Supreme Court for the trial of impeachments, or rather a Tribunal of which that should form a part"".

Monroe on Impeachment

Our 5th President, James Monroe, writing during the five years between the end of his second term and his death, was optimistic about the ability of our impeachment provisions to maintain an honest body of civil officers. He wrote, in The People The Sovereigns (p. 16): ""The right of impeachment and of trial by the legislature is the mainspring of the great machine of government. . . If preserved in full vigor and exercised with perfect integrity, every branch will perform its duty and the people will perform theirs."" The willingness of Monroe and Hamilton to entrust impeachment trials to the legislative branch may be explained, in part, by their taking a monarchy (England) as their model.

Our Constitution and Impeachment

The reports of our two presidential trials indicate that our Constitution's presidential impeachment system is malfunctioning in a serious way. That is, it is functioning politically spite the fact that our senators and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are sworn to make it function impartially. In large part because of this failure, it has also been a dismal failure at discouraging presidential violations of our Constitution. It is impossible to say how much of our present government's chaos is due to the failure of the impeachment provisions. We do know, however, that our framers relied on them to motivate the civil officers of the three branches to dedicate themselves to our interests above their own. We also know that the Americans of the 18th C. could not anticipate the two-party system or the 17th Amendment of 1913. If they had, it seems unlikely that they would have trusted the Senate to vote impartially..

In regard to the entire milieu of high-grade Freemasonry during the Enlightenment, the Philalèthes are as noteworthy as they come. The Rite itself - more of a regime - and the Lodge ‘Amis Réunis’ from which it was founded, constituted a clearing house for all things occult or esoteric on the continent and beyond; Savalette de Langes and the Marquis de Chefdebien may even be described as engaging in Masonic espionage. There isn’t a single volume on 18th Century Freemasonry that doesn’t give the major details of the Amis Réunis and the Philalèthes. Members of the rite came not only from France, but from Germany, England, Italy, Austria, Sweden and Russia (and as was shown with the publishing of J. J. C. Bode’s diary in 1994, the Bavarian Illuminati had managed to officially join forces with it just two years before the revolution). I’ve read more than a few accounts of the Philalèthes over the years, but this report by Frick - about as complete an introduction as as you’ll find - is by far the best. *** › Continue reading

Lodge of Les Amis Réunis [The United Friends] Tuesday, August 25th, 2009 | Freemasonry, Philalèthes | 2 Comments We’ll be mentioning this famous Lodge in Paris in forthcoming posts. What follows is a concise explanation of its operation and makeup (translated from a French Masonic Encyclopedia entry by Pierre François Pinaud). *** Amis Réunis From 1771 to 1791, this lodge was one of the most prestigious in Paris and was consecrated by the Keeper of the Royal Treasury Savalette de Langes. Initially formed abroad in Rumigny, a small town of Thiérache, by a magistrate of the Parliament of Paris (banished by Chancellor Maupeou), in 1773 the lodge settled permanently in Paris. Savalette de Langes had made the inner circle of the Amis Réunis the social center of modern Freemasonry and cosmopolitanism of the late Enlightenment. Here the elite and and the talented joined together. The orchestra of the Amis Réunis was composed of six musicians of renown, like the composer [Isidore] Bertheaume, the brothers Blasius, the King’s violinists, Boutray of the l’Académie [Royale] de Musique, and either the brothers Breval or Louis Francoeur, the King’s Superintendent of Music. The Lodge utilized a large space in a house in the Rue Popincourt, built in 1708 by the architect Dulin for the supplier of arms [Nicholas?] Dunoyer. Upon his death in 1791, Les Amis Réunis counted some 300 members with a further 37 casual brothers and brother servants. It comprised about 12% foreigners, such as the Baron de Beutz, chancellor of Saxony; the Baron de Gleichen, Minister of Denmark in Madrid, Naples and Paris; and Count Stroganoff, a Russian subject. A hundred senior officers or generals decorate the pillars, and about fifteen of their regiment. Painters and sculptors are well represented with a dozen doctors, all members of the Academy of Medicine or professors at the University of Paris - Monge was an assiduous member of the lodge for some years. But the Amis Réunis’ uniqueness is the significant number of its members who belonged to the world of finance: 37% of the Lodge in total, 84 people, were indeed financiers. We count no fewer than 15 bankers or speculators, 13 receiver generals, 7 tax collectors [fermiers généraux], 7 general treasurers including those of the Navy and War, 4 general paymasters, 19 members of the Courts of Finances of Paris, 7 senior officials of the Royal treasury and finally, 11 brothers who were occupied with public finance. On the eve of the Revolution, the lodge of the Amis Réunis had the highest concentration of financiers; a number of them met in groups, or independently, to engage in speculative ventures. We also find Lodge members as shareholders of the arms factory in Charleville, the Water Company in Paris, and the mines at Baïgorry, Decize or Rueil. Another group actively participated in speculation about the dollars held by the bank St. Charles de Madrid. Others are shareholders of the Hudson Bay Company that traded with Canada. Many specialize in international commerce, and others with India or the islands trading sugar and rum, but also the slave trade. At the famous East India Company, one finds Lodge members as shareholders or as administrators. A last group is actively involved in real estate speculation in Paris. The success of the Amis Réunis in the financial world may be explained by the fact that, in the latter third of the 18th-century, in the absence of public credit, only powerful financiers could undertake large scale financial transactions. Everything is then prefaced upon trust. This leads to the membership of professional lobbyists, and familial networks which are found in the Lodge. The trustworthiness of Masonic affiliation may result in more business, which enables both administrators and profiteers. The Lodge therefore offered a discreet setting for financial conversations and the development of protective relationships; philosophical bonds are then the natural extension in the world of finance.

The So-Called Schwedenkiste (“Swedish Box”), the Most Significant Illuminati Archive Wednesday, June 17th, 2009 | Primary Documents | 7 Comments by Terry Melanson (17/6/2009) After Adam Weishaupt had fled in 1785, the center of activity for the Illuminati shifted from Bavaria to the Duchies of Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Weimar. And while the founder of the Illuminati was content to safely settle down for the long haul at the court of Duke Ernst II of Saxe Gotha, Johann Joachim Christoph Bode (1730-1793) took the reins and assumed the role previously held by Weishaupt. Through the efforts of Bode and an expanding network of recruits – and under the protection of the Illuminati Dukes Karl August of Saxe-Weimar and Ernst II of Saxe-Gotha – new colonies were established in places like France, Russia and Italy. Bode kept the Weimar and Gotha Lodges Amalia and Ernst Zum Kompass informed of his activities, but the bulk of the evidence of continued Illuminati activity remained in his possession. Ensuring that whatever they contained would remain secret, upon Bode’s death in December 1793 his literary executor, Illuminatus Christian Gottlieb von Voigt (1743–1819), transferred his deceased friend’s possessions to Duke Ernst II of Saxe-Gotha who had already bought the voluminous papers before Bode died. › Continue reading

“Master Conspiracy” Redux Monday, June 15th, 2009 | Illuminati myths | 9 Comments by Terry Melanson (15/6/2009) The New American website has posted a slightly redacted version of William H. McIlhany’s 1996 article which appeared in the September 16, 1996 issue of The New American. (The original can be read here, which, in turn, appears to be based on one of McIlhany’s presentations). I first became aware of McIlhany’s writings on the Illuminati in 2000. At the time I was very impressed by what I read, and immediately realized that his information on the real Bavarian Illuminati was more thorough than most. However, my own knowledge on the subject is a bit more advanced than it was some nine years ago. So with that in mind, here are some exaggerations and/or misrepresentations which struck me as I reread the article at The New American for the first time in years. “Kölmer” and the Origin of the Lesser and Greater Mysteries of the Illuminati According to McIlhany, Weishaupt was “instructed by a mysterious occultist named Kölmer.” The only problem I have with this statement is that it is not qualified with “alleged” or “purported.” The Kölmer legend first appeared in Volume III of Abbé Augustin Barruel’s tome against Philosophes, Freemasons, the Illuminati and the Jacobins. He related it rather tentatively as a rumour going round, and as a possible way of explaining the ostensibly advanced nature of Weishaupt’s mysteries. › Continue reading

“Lang” or “Lanz”: Myths about the “Myths” Saturday, November 15th, 2008 | Illuminati myths | 4 Comments by Terry Melanson (15/11/2008) So, I’m browsing through the results of a keyword-search (targeting blogs) that I had previously saved as an RSS feed in Google Reader - “Illuminati.” Usually the results point to sites that abuse the term as a mere descriptor for an overarching, all-powerful monolithic conspiracy. However, once in a while, I occasionally come across at least an attempt not to knowingly butcher the historical record. The November 12th post at the English section of Illuminaten.org is one such example. But as I started reading “The Bavarian Illuminati: several myths revealed,” it became quite clear that the post is, in fact - word for word - an abridged re-posting of “A Bavarian Illuminati Primer.” Once I got to the part about Lanz and Lang, I knew for sure. Here’s what Mason Trevor W. McKeown thinks is the myth/truth: As an example of the mythology that surrounds the history of the Illuminati, note that Barruel claimed that Lanz, an Illuminati courier and apostate priest, was struck by lightning, thus revealing Weishaupt’s papers to the authorities, but this does not appear to be substantiated. This error was widely reprinted and enlarged on by subsequent anti-masons whose lack of research and disdain for historical accuracy has lead them to confuse Johann Jakob Lanz (d.1785), a non-Illuminati secular priest in Erding, and friend of Weishaupt, with Franz Georg Lang, a court advisor in Eichstätt who was active in the Illuminati under the name Tamerlan. Barruel mistakenly translated “weltpriester”, or secular priest, as apostate priest and subsequent writers such as Webster and Miller have repeated this error. Eckert renamed Weishaupt’s friend as Lanze and had him struck by lightning while carrying dispatches in Silesia. Miller cited Eckert but renamed Lanz as Jacob Lang and placed the lightning strike in Ratisbon. This is a minor detail in the history but it demonstrates the lack of accuracy often displayed by detractors of the Illuminati. As nobody has challenged him on these assertions - not even a German site who should know better - I’ll reiterate and add additional information to what I had written back in August 2005. Mr. McKeown is guilty of the same thing he accuses others of: “lack of research and disdain for historical accuracy.” › Continue reading

Illuminati Sightseeing: Karl and St. Germain at Louisenlund Monday, November 10th, 2008 | Illuminati Sightseeing | 2 Comments by Terry Melanson (10/11/2008) The estate of (Illuminatus) Landgrave Karl von Hessen-Kassel (1744-1836) was an occult-masonic initiatory retreat. The world’s foremost expert on the 18th-Century Golden and Rosy Cross, Dr. Christopher McIntosh: The head of the Asiatic Brethren in the 1780s and 1790s was the Landgrave Carl von Hessen-Kassel, one of the most fascinating and influential figures at the time in the world of Masonry, Rosicrucianism and hermetic studies. He not only belonged to innumerable orders and rites, but he was a practicing alchemist and was a friend of the mysterious French alchemist, the Comte de St. Germain, whom he harbored during the last years of St. Germain’s life on his estate Louisenlund in what is now Schleswig-Holstein, which he turned into a great center of Masonic and esoteric activity. The park at Louisenlund (about an hour’s drive northwest of Kiel) was laid out in the form of an initiatic journey that involved the candidate passing through a dense wood finding his way through a labyrinth and encountering various alchemical and allegorical images along the way. In the park was an alchemist’s tower with a laboratory and a room where Masonic rituals were conducted. There was also a pond with a secret grotto concealed behind a waterfall, in which the most solemn rituals were held. Over the years, unfortunately, most of these symbolic features have disappeared. All that remains of the alchemist’s tower, for example, is this Egyptian stone doorway which was moved to a different position, and cemented into the wall of a stable building where it stands completely out of context. Today this property belongs to a private school. › Continue reading",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0," An impartial presidential impeachment trial might well lead us toward a more honest, responsive body of civil officers and possibly even a less militaristic foreign policy .

112,113,Call for Civil War to be remembered with memorial to all victims,Mississippi Wants Court Redo of 15-Week Abortion Ban Challenge,"A memorial to all those who died in the Civil War is under consideration by the group set up to advise the Government on commemorations.

Between 1,500 and 2,000 people - the exact figure has never been determined - died in the short, but vicious Civil War between June 1922 and May 1923 which followed the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

Despite its seminal importance in the history of the State, there is no national memorial to commemorate the war.

Dr Maurice Manning, the chair of the Government’s expert advisory group on commemorations, said the group have discussed a permanent memorial.

Dr Manning said the most obvious option is to rededicate the cenotaph on the lawn of Leinster House to all the victims of the Civil War. It is currently dedicated to the memory of Arthur Griffth, Michael Collins and Kevin O’Higgins, three of the most prominent pro-Treaty politicians.

However, the memorial is within the grounds of Leinster House and is not open to the public.

Dr Manning said the group is open to consideration for a public memorial either there or in a different place.

“I’m keen that there be a public debate on this. What form should the memorial take? We should have a debate if the Leinster Lawn is suitable or some other place. I think it is much more practical to think anew,” he suggested.

“Is it a good idea to commission a permanent memorial to all those who died in the Civil War. The idea of a day of reconciliation is a good idea, but how do you structure it?”

Dr Manning said now is the right time to commemorate the Civil War as the bitterness had dissipated over the last almost 100 years.

In its guidance to the Government on the second half of the decade of centenarries, the advisory group recommended the State should take a “reflective and reconciliatory tone” in relation to the Civil War that recognises “neither side had the monopoly of either atrocity or virtue and this was true of words as well as actions.”

It said the silences that followed the Civil War could now be replaced by “meaningful engagements with a difficult and traumatic time”.

It went on to state the consequences of the actions on all sides, and the depth, sincerity, or sometimes anger and sense of retribution underpinning those actions, needs to be confronted as part of any meaningful commemoration.”","Mississippi is asking the entire Fifth Circuit to reconsider striking down a law that prohibits previability abortions after a fetus reaches 15 weeks’ gestation.

Bans on abortions that take place before a fetus is capable of living outside the womb “are unconstitutional regardless of the State’s interests,” the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit said.

113,114,Suspects released without bail after shocking attacks on Jews,Guardian Angels to patrol Jewish neighborhoods in New York City after recent attacks,"Suspects arrested in last week’s spree of eight anti-Semitic attacks are being quickly released right back into the neighborhoods they terrorized thanks to “bail reform” legislation — which doesn’t even take effect until Jan. 1.

The most recent case of revolving-door justice came Saturday morning, with the release, with no bail, of a woman charged with punching and cursing at three Orthodox women, ages 22, 26 and 31, in Crown Heights, Brooklyn at dawn the day before.

The accused assailant, Tiffany Harris, was hauled in handcuffs before a Brooklyn judge on 21 menacing, harassment and attempted assault charges.

“F-U, Jews!” Harris, 30, of Flatbush, allegedly shouted during the attack.

“Yes, I was there,” Harris later admitted to cops, according to the criminal complaint against her.

“Yes, I slapped them. I cursed them out. I said ‘F-U, Jews.”

As she stood before a judge in Brooklyn Criminal Court with the hood to a navy blue jacket over her head, Harris was in familiar territory.

She still has an open harassment and assault case on the Brooklyn docket from November 2018.

And last month, she was sentenced to no jail time for felony criminal mischief in Manhattan, court records show — a case for which she had repeatedly failed to make court appearances.

Brooklyn prosecutors didn’t even bother requesting bail Saturday, as they could have, given that the reform law, approved in April, technically doesn’t take effect until Jan. 1.

“The de Blasio administration has made it clear that we all need to get into compliance with bail reform now,” said a law enforcement source.

“If prosecutors had asked for bail, corrections would release them immediately,” or they would be sprung on Jan. 1, the source said.

Brooklyn Criminal Court Judge Laura Johnson even made mention of the coming bail reform legislation in ordering Harris freed.

“So I’m releasing her on consent and also because it will be required under the statute in just a few days,” the judge said.

“Ms. Harris you’re being released on your own recognizance.”

She was issued an order of protection barring contact with the three victims — and a court date of Jan. 10.

Harris broke into a grin when approached by a reporter. “Why do you want to know?” she said. ”Goodbye.”

The legislation requires arraignment judges to set free suspects in any non-sexual assault that doesn’t actually cause a physical injury, even in cases of hate crime attacks.

“If there is an injury, then bail could be requested, because then it would be considered a violent felony,” explained Insha Rahman, who, as director of strategy and new initiatives at the Vera Institute of Justice, worked closely with legislators and the governor’s office in drafting the controversial reforms.

The no-injury loophole will mean a quick get-out-of-jail free card for all but one of the accused attackers in the eight Hanukkah-timed, anti-Semitic bias crimes that have terrified the city’s Orthodox communities.

“You have to beat the hell out of somebody — or murder them — for there to be any consequences,” said former state lawmaker Dov Hikind, founder of Americans Against Anti-Semitism. “Otherwise, you are set free.”

He continued: “It’s open season in New York — open season on innocent people. On Jews, on Muslims, on gay people. It applies to anybody. But it’s the Jewish people in particular who have been targeted.”

Only one of last week’s eight attacks resulted in an actual physical injury — that of a 65-year-old Jewish man who was punched and kicked on Monday morning at East 41st Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan.

“F–k you, Jew bastard!” the petrified victim told cops his assailant shouted.

The suspect in that crime, Steven Jorge, 28, is indeed alleged to have injured his victim, and so was ordered locked up with no bail pending a psychological examination.

Jorge, though, is the exception.

On Friday night, a suspect in another of the hate attacks was similarly sprung with no bail, though in her case she was at least ordered to attend twice-monthly mental health appointments.

“You f—king Jew, the end is coming for you!” that suspect, Ayana Logan, 43, allegedly shouted as she swung a handbag at a 34-year-old Orthodox mom in Gravesend.

The mother had been holding the hand of her 3-year-old son when the unprovoked attack happened, according to the criminal court complaint against Logan.

By Saturday night, Logan, Harris, and Jorge remained the only suspects apprehended in the hate spree. The assailants in the remaining five attacks remain at large.

Rahman and other reformers argue that the vast majority of suspects in minor assaults are quickly released anyway — and that the new bail reform lets judges set conditions for release that can address the underlying mental-health issues.

“That can be mental health counseling, a stay-away order, which wasn’t readily available before, as conditions for release,” said Rahman.

Suspects are getting none of that during their pretrial stays in city jails, Rahman noted.

“Money bail, and keeping someone temporarily detained with no care, doesn’t address at all the long term concerns” of community safety and the well-being of suspects, she said.

But in the city’s Orthodox neighborhoods, there was outrage in learning that even when violent bigots are caught, they’ll be immediately released.

“They were released on bail?” a 32-year-old Orthodox man asked a Post reporter near where the three women were attacked. “Disgusting.”

Steve Benjamin, 30, of Borough Park, said, “We’re scared to walk at night in the street.

“There is a lot of hate here and I don’t know why. People in the community are scared. It’s very dangerous. It’s just like remembering the days before World War II. I don’t let my kids out alone.

“It should be more justice — they arrest them, but they let them out of jail a day later.”","The Guardian Angels, an unarmed crime-prevention group, said it would begin patrolling the New York City borough of Brooklyn on Sunday following a series of attacks against Jews.

114,115,Police investigate string of fast food robberies in Metro Detroit,VIDEO: Fast-Food Bandits Sought In Multiple Robberies Around Metro Detroit,"DETROIT – Police said robbers have been targeting fast food restaurants across Metro Detroit.

At least five restaurants targeted have been in Oakland, Macomb and Wayne counties. Police are starting to believe the same group is behind all of the robberies.

Police are taking the men very seriously, because they are threatening to have guns while committing the crimes. New footage has been revealed that could bring investigators one step closer to catching the culprits.

In just the last few weeks the robberies have become more common. In some cases it’s two men making violent demands, escaping in a burgundy SUV and in other cases it’s one man acting alone and then fleeing on foot.

Robbery locations potentially connected:

Taco Bell in Livonia on Dec. 15

Fast Food restaurant in Independence Township on Dec. 21

Taco Bell in Milford on Dec. 25

Burger King in Auburn Hills on Dec. 27

Tim Horton’s in Roseville","LIVONIA (WWJ) - The search is on for a group of robbers who have been targeting fast-food restaurants in Metro Detroit.

Over the past two weeks, at least four fast-food restaurants across the area have been robbed shortly after opening for business for the day and police believe the same suspects are behind the crimes.

Livonia police say a single masked suspect robbed the Taco Bell on Merriman Road near Plymouth Road on December 15, implying he had a gun. A similar crime was reported at an unidentified fast-food restaurant in Independence Township on Dec. 21. Two masked suspects also robbed a Taco Bell restaurant in Milford on Dec. 24, as well as a Burger King restaurant in Auburn Hills on Dec. 27.

[VIDEO: Milford Taco Bell Robbed By Masked Men]

The suspects in the Livonia and Auburn Hills robberies were caught on surveillance videos fleeing in the same vehicle -- an older model maroon or red Ford Explorer with dark bottom trim and running boards. Witnesses also reported a vehicle matching the same description fleeing from the Milford robbery.

Security cameras captured images of the suspects, one of whom was carrying a blue backpack during the Milford and Auburn Hills robberies. The suspects are described as black males in their 20s, with hoods pulled up over their heads and their faces covered.

It's unclear how much cash the suspects took in the Livonia and Independence Township robberies, but they got about $200 from the Milford robbery. The employees in the Auburn Hills robbery refused to give the suspects money and said they were calling police, which sent the suspects running.

115,116,Kleverness Smart Lighting review: This hub-based lighting system is unfinished and expensive,Vanessa Hudgens Rocks A Swimsuit With Snow In The Backdrop,"Posted By TheNewsCommenter: From Techhive.com: “Kleverness Smart Lighting review: This hub-based lighting system is unfinished and expensive”. Below is an excerpt from the article.

Kleverness proudly bills its products as “the best, easiest and smartest solution for your home’s lighting.” I can categorically tell you that none of those claims are accurate, and that today Kleverness is not worth serious consideration if you want to outfit your home with smart lights.

The hockey puck-sized Klever Hub requires just the ethernet hookup and a power connection, and then you’re ready to connect via the Kleverness app to get things going. Or so I thought. After registering your name, email address, and a password with the app, you must wait for a confirmation code to be delivered via email before you can proceed. I registered and waited… and waited… and it wasn’t until nearly an hour later that my confirmation code finally arrived, after which time I had already created a new account with a different email address. This time the code landed in a spam folder, another aggravation.

The next step in setup is to scan a QR code on the underside of the Hub to register it to the app. I scanned, and the connection failed. I tried twice again, same result. After unplugging the Hub and plugging it back in, I tried a fourth time. The app crashed. The fifth try turned out to be the charm.

After a lengthy firmware update, I was finally ready to get started adding Kleverness components. Marketed as a smart lighting solution, Kleverness does not sell light bulbs. Instead, it sells an in-wall switch, an in-wall dimmer, and a plug-in outlet. The system’s goal is not to give you tunable lighting options but rather a way to control the lights you already have. Note that all this gear requires the Klever Hub to work.

It may come as no surprise to hear that the Kleverness app crashed over and over again when I was setting up these devices (more QR codes to be scanned), requiring multiple force-quits of the app and power cycling the Hub before I finally got anything to work. All told, I spent 2.5 hours working with the Kleverness system to get just one plug-in outlet working.

The front of the ensemble featured a tiger graphic. Its tail wound up her right strap, and it looked like it was getting ready to pounce. The swimsuit had a classic cut, with thick straps and a basic scoop-neckline.

Vanessa stood with her hands in her hair and her elbows out to her sides. At the same time, she bent her right knee slightly and looked into the distance to her left.

The So You Think You Can Dance judge had a flirty smile on her lips. She wore her hair up in a casual bun. Her accessories included a choker-style necklace, which she paired with a longer one. She also sported circular earrings but no bracelet.

The stunner stood in front of a fence beside a light-tiled wall. Beyond that were other buildings closer in, along with a steep hill that filled the entire frame. There were small cabins that dotted the background, with at least five visible in the shot. Towards the top of the frame, the scenery gave way to a forested area.

This picture was taken on a sunny day, which made for a bright backdrop. Vanessa, on the other hand, stood in the shadows. This meant that her makeup was hard to discern, although her dark lipstick popped in the shot.

In addition, a towel or robe hung on a black railing, which was presumably hers.

Fans headed to the comments section to gush about the bombshell.

“Ahhhh you did go! ENJOYYYY,” expressed model, Camila Coelho.

“You are perfect Happy new year! Love you forever,” raved an admirer.

Others were distracted by the snow.

“Just looking at this pic is making me freeze,” joked a fan.

“Omg your face looks so cozy but the snow talks about a different story,” wrote a fourth Instagram user.

In addition, the bombshell was spotted in another one-piece swimsuit last summer, on August 11. This time, it was a strapless and colorful number. There were bright yellow-and-white horizontal stripes. Vanessa wore a straw hat on her back and slung a matching bag on her left arm. The bag was arguably a little more eye-catching, as it featured black feather accents along the top. She glanced to her left and appeared to be mid-stride in shallow ocean waters.

Here's a quick look at all that should grab the eyeballs from the world of entertainment in 2020.

Akshay Kumar

As of now, he has his eyes on two major festival dates, having lined up a big film on Eid as well as Diwali 2020. While he starts off his year on a regular Friday in March with ""Sooryavanshi"", Akshay looks set to go on collision with Salman Khan on Eid. While Salman has mentioned ""Radhe"" for the festival, the trade says Akshay plans to release ""Laxmmi Bomb"" on the same date. And although Diwali 2019 wasn't that great for ""Housefull 4"", he will be back on India's biggest festival this year with the historical drama ""Prithviraj"".

Ayushmann Khurrana

Having scored clear box-office winners that have also impressed critics over seven consecutive films now, any film starring Ayushmann automatically becomes a newsmaker. In 2020, he will play a gay character in ""Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan"" and also team up with Amitabh Bachchan in Shoojit Sircar's ""Gulabo Sitabo"". Looks like a surefire strategy to extend his strike rate to nine consecutive winners!

Social Media Superstars

These days, you don't necessarily need a film release to be popular. Ask Priyanka and Nick, Deepika and Ranveer, or Alia and Ranbir. In a nation obsessed with filmstars, the simple act of posting a picture on Instagram can guarantee much more mileage than the months of labour that shooting for a film entails. Sunny Leone, Shraddha Kapoor, and Sonam Kapoor continue to be darlings of the nation simply by intelligent utilisation of the power of social media, as do Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar.

The Heroine Oriented Films

Deepika Padukone in ""Chhapak"", Alia Bhatt in ""Gangubai Kathiawadi"", Kangana Ranaut in ""Panga"" and ""Thalaivi"", Kriti Sanon in ""Mimi"" and Kiara Advani in ""Indoo Ki Jawaani"" are but only a few heroine-centric films that will continue the wave of projects that present strong and authentic women to actresses and also celebrate the spirit of womanhood.

Ranveer Singh

With ""83"", Ranveer Singh aims at taking the biopic formula to the next level. He plays Kapil Dev, captain of the team that won the cricket World Cup for the first time in 1983. It was an epochal moment for Indian sports, and also a major boost to the spirit of nationalism. Director Kabir Khan should clinch a sureshot winner when the film releases on April 10.

Ranbir-Alia

Star couple Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt has always been in the news for some reason or the other. But 2020 will probably keep them in the news a little more than before. It is time, after all, for people to witness chemistry on screen, when ""Brahmastra"" releases.

Celebrity Weddings

Will Varun Dhawan tie the knot with girlfriend Natasha Dalal? Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt actually get married this year? And -- the question that never goes out of fashion -- will Salman Khan finally, finally tie the knot? If 2018 saw the weddings of Priyanka-Nick, Ranveer-Deepika and Sonam Kapoor-Anand Ahuja, then 2019 has been the year when rumours of romances sustained the gossip vine. Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor made their relationship public, while Farhan Akhtar and Shibani Dandekar's love grew stronger. Will 2020 see some power shaadis?

Bhatt's Union

Mahesh Bhatt will direct both daughters, Alia and Pooja, together in ""Sadak 2"" his return to direction for the first time two decades, since ""Zakhm"" in 1999. ""Sadak 2"" opens in July, 2020.

Comeback of Irrfan Khan

After fighting neuroendocrine tumour, Irrfan Khan is back in action. He will be on the big screen after almost three years in ""Angrezi Medium"", which is scheduled to release in March. Directed by Homi Adajania and co-starring Kareena Kapoor, the movie is a sequel to the multiplex hit, ""Hindi Medium"".

Small Films

Although most of Bollywood's biggest grossers at the box-office are still out-and-out commercial biggies (think ""War"", ""Dabangg 3"" or ""Kabir Singh""), the volume of the small, content-driven film has increased gradually over the years. In a multiplex-centric market, content is king, and modestly-mounted films such as ""Article 15"", ""Bala"" and ""Uri"" prove that fact. Small, content-driven fare will continue to dominate most Fridays in 2020, too.

Newcomers

Ex-Miss World Manushi Chillar makes her debut opposite Akshay Kumar in the mega-budget period drama ""Prithviraj"", while Shalini Pandey is Ranveer Singh's heroine in ""Jayeshbhai Jordaar"". National Award-winner Keerthi Suresh will be seen opposite Ajay Devgn in the sports drama ""Maidaan"". Krystle D'souza, who has made her mark on TV, makes her debut in the Amitabh Bachchan-Emraan Hashmi-starrer ""Chehre"". There are Bollywood's industry kids, too, lined up for debut. Sunil Shetty's son Ahan Shetty (""Tadap""), Chunky Pandey' son Ahan Pandey (project yet to be declared), Pooja Bedi's daughter Alaia F. (""Jawaani Jaaneman""), and Katrina Kaif's sister Isabelle Kaif (""Kwatha"") will be seen on the Hindi screen for the first time this year.

3D Back in Bollywood

This year, there are two films lined up, which will have 3D prints -- ""Street Dancer 3D"" and ""Tanhaji"". Although Bollywood has been trying time and again to come up with great 3D entertainment, budgetary constraints normally bar the creation of perfect entertainers in the expensive format. With evolving technology on their side, can 'Street Dancer"" and ""Tanhaji"" break the jinx?

Remixes and Recreations

Sadly, these will dominate the music scene, no matter what. We all know how obsessed Bollywood is now with remixes these days. The year of 2020 also seems to give the audience the same dose of recreations. Actor Saif Ali Khan is all set to give his fans some '90s nostalgia as he will be recreating his hit song ""Ole ole"" from movie ""Yeh Dillagi"". The revamped version, which has been composed by Tanishk Bagchi and sung by Yash Narvekar, will feature in Saif and Tabu-starrer upcoming film ""Jawaani Jaaneman"".

Non-Film Indian Music

Spearhedead by Punjabi pop stars, non-film music has become more robust than ever. If B Praak, Dhwani Bhanushali, Darshan Rawal, and The Doorbeens went from strength to strength, they will be back next year with many more new songs in the non-film genre, which has opened up again with the advent of growing streaming facilities. Even top Bollywood playback stars such as Arijit Singh and Neha Kakkar cannot resist getting into non-film mood once in a while.

Gal Gadot Returns as Wonder Woman

Gal Gadot will be back as Wonder Woman with edgier action for a new battle with new villains. The much-awaited ""Wonder Woman 1984"", a sequel of the megahit 2017 DC film, is one of the most anticipated films of 2020. The film, directed by Patty Jenkins, comes with tag line ""A new era of wonder begins"", and it will be interesting to watch what era will usher in with the movie. It is scheduled to open on June 5, 2020.

Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow

After years of anticipation, Marvel Studios will finally release a solo ""Black Widow"" movie, redefining the superhero universe with women power in focus. The film will bring back Scarlett Johansson in the avatar of Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow as she traces her past to solve puzzle of her life. It marks the beginning of Marvel's Phase 4. The film is slated to release in India on April 30, 2020 -- a day before its release in the US.

Daniel Craig's Last Outing as James Bond

Will ""No Time To Die"" really be Daniel Craig's last outing as James Bond? Will the film introduce a new James Bond? Will there be a female James Bond? Will it present first black Bond? All these questions will be answered with the release of 25th Bond film. Directed by new-age maverick and Emmy-winner Cary Joji Fukunaga, the film will open in April.

Christopher Nolan Returns with Tenet

Visionary filmmaker Christopher Nolan will return with some mindbending drama in his much-hyped ""Tenet"". Described as an action epic evolving from the world of international espionage, the movie comes with a time travel twist as Robert Pattinson's character and John David Washington's character try to stop an event before the time runs out. Mumbai plays an important role in the spy drama. Also starring actress Dimple Kapadia, the film will release in July.

Disney Plus Comes to India

Disney Plus intensified streaming wars internationally with its launch in November last year. The war will heat up with the platform entering Indian market. The service is expected to arrive in India in the second half of 2020, post the Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament. There will be no separate app as the whole catalog will be available on Hotstar.

Netflix Pumps in Rs 3000 Cr in Indian Content

India will be on the radar of American streaming service Netflix, with plans to invest Rs 3,000 crore on producing exclusive content in India in the immediate future. Star power is going to be one of the most important driving forces for the platform. Bollywood biggies such as Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma are associated with the platform to create content.

117,118,White evangelicals love Trump. Religious voters? Not so much.,Who Cares? Everyone. Why 2020 Will Be the Year of Persuasion,"(CNN) Much has been made of President Donald Trump's strong standing with voters on the religious right, especially after a Christianity Today editorial called for Trump to be impeached and removed from office. The editorial generated a lot of press because Trump won white born-again evangelicals with more than 75% of the vote in 2016 and his approval rating with them remains at 75% in CNN/SSRS polling taken in the middle of last year.

Figures such as these, however, can often obscure as much as they reveal. Trump's standing with all religious voters -- and, in particular, nonwhite religious voters -- is considerably weaker than it is among white evangelicals.

Heading into the 2020 general election, Trump can certainly count on the strong backing of white born-again evangelicals. If he loses, however, it'll be in part because his approval rating is only in the low 40s among those who attend religious services at least once a week and are not white born-again evangelicals.

Even when we concentrate on born-again evangelicals, there are plenty of nonwhite Americans. In fact, nearly 40% of born-again evangelicals nationwide are not white. This includes nearly 20% who are African American. (In a Democratic primary, the majority of born-again evangelicals are nonwhite.)

Simply put, Trump's not popular with nonwhite born-again evangelical voters. His approval rating with them was a mere 29% in an average of April and May CNN polls. Among African American born-again evangelicals, Trump's average approval rating was just 7%. These figures are pretty much unchanged from the percentage of these groups who voted for Trump in 2016, according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES).

Daniel Malloy is OZY’s U.S. politics editor.

There are a lot of numbers to think about when it comes to this year’s presidential election. But here’s a big one to chew on: 59 percent. That’s the proportion of Americans who are eligible to vote who cast a ballot for president in 2016. The number was up slightly from 2012, and down a bit from a historic high in 2008. But going back decades, the story is roughly the same: 40 percent of the population doesn’t cast a ballot.

In an age where political engagement is through the roof thanks to President Donald Trump, who stokes the strongest of feelings among his supporters and detractors, America is largely dug in. The persuadable middle seems to shrink by the day. That’s why OZY is devoting a large part of our 2020 election coverage to answering the question: Who Cares?

To that end, we partnered with Washington-based data firm 0ptimus to take an unprecedented dive into the last four election cycles to show you — on a county-by-county basis — where voters are turning out and where they are not. We’ve already told you about trends like the Apathy Belt, where voter turnout has sagged, and the county where 100 percent of eligible voters came out to the polls.

In 2020, we will spend the election season telling you about the people and trends behind the mobilization efforts that will determine whether Trump gets a second term.

Campaigning “has been continually shifting away from persuasion and more toward turnout in the overall sense,” says Brian Reisinger, a Republican political strategist in Wisconsin who worked on Sen. Ron Johnson’s 2016 campaign there.

A couple of caveats are necessary. No. 1: Voter turnout does not simply rest on caring or commitment. There are ongoing legal battles across the country over barriers to voting — which can disproportionately affect the poor, students and people of color.

No. 2: Persuasion still matters, and not just for those Obama-Trump voters who have been endlessly dissected for the past three years. Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, says the reason many Black voters did not show up for Hillary Clinton in 2016 is not because they weren’t mobilized, but because they weren’t persuaded. “The mistake people will make is they assume that this will be a mobilization base, and they will not have a persuasion plan for them,” Shropshire says. She points to how the Trump campaign is already mounting an effort online and in predominately African American neighborhoods to siphon away some of the Black vote, and she urges Democrats not to wait until after Labor Day to fire up this core constituency.

Part of motivating African Americans to come out and vote blue — as they have historically at around 90 percent — will require a focus on an affirmative vision, not merely an anti-Trump message, Shropshire says. She points to a recent BlackPAC-funded poll of registered African American voters that found big majorities in favor of free public college tuition (76 percent), a wealth tax (71 percent), reparations (71 percent), Medicare for All (65 percent) and the Green New Deal (57 percent) to argue that a Democratic candidate proposing big things will have a better time motivating these voters. In the presidential primary, these issues remain a point of contention. As Bernie Sanders put it in December’s Democratic debate: “You don’t have the largest voter turnout unless you create energy and excitement. And you don’t create energy and excitement unless you are prepared to take on the people who own America and are prepared to speak to the people who are working in America.” He then went on to reference Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and free college.

Of course, those policies can also serve to motivate Republicans, who will be throwing the word “socialism” around whether Sanders, a self-described Democratic Socialist, is the nominee or not.

But the biggest mobilizer for Republicans right now is impeachment. “Engagement is pretty off the charts,” Reisinger says, with the House voting to impeach Trump and the Senate trial likely to begin this month. Republicans have turned the proceedings into a fundraising bonanza, with Trump seeming to relish talking about it on the stump as he casts the inquiry as illegitimate.

Reisinger acknowledges that Democrats are fired up too, as evidenced by their wins in Wisconsin and nationally in 2018. “We’re used to knife’s-edge elections,” he says, “and we’re used to each side fighting to the end for every last inch.”

Analysts expect that 59 percent to rise this year. The party that best taps into America’s missing 40 percent is the one that will lay claim to the White House come November.

Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Brian Reisinger worked on Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign. He worked for Sen. Ron Johnson.

119,120,Top UN official accuses US of torturing Chelsea Manning,LOOK: Anne Curtis proudly shows off baby bump in stunning photoshoot,"Ex-Army intelligence analyst jailed over refusal to testify against WikiLeaks reportedly subjected to ‘severe measures of coercion’

A top United Nations official has accused the US government of using torture against Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst currently jailed in the US over her refusal to testify against WikiLeaks.

Nils Melzer, UN special rapporteur on torture, made the charge in a letter sent in November but only released on Tuesday.

In the missive, Melzer says Manning is being subjected to “an open-ended, progressively severe measure of coercion fulfilling all the constitutive elements of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.

Manning, who was detained on 16 May after refusing to testify before a grand jury, is currently being held at the Alexandria Detention Center in Virginia until she agrees to give evidence or until the grand jury’s term expires in November next year. She also faces fines currently running at $1,000 a day.

In the letter, Melzer writes: “The practise of coercive deprivation of liberty for civil contempt … involves the intentional infliction of progressively severe mental and emotional suffering for the purposes of coercion and intimidation at the order of judicial authorities.”

Warning that “victims of prolonged coercive confinement have demonstrated post-traumatic symptoms and other severe and persistent mental and physical health consequences”, the UN representative said Manning’s detention “is not a lawful sanction but an open-ended, progressively severe coercive measure amounting to torture & should be discontinued & abolished without delay”.

Mannings’ lawyers have argued that her detention is “for refusing to comply with a grand jury is pointless, punitive, and cruel” and warned that she is not likely to change her mind.

In a letter released in March when Manning was first sent back to jail, her lawyers warned: “Chelsea has clearly stated her moral objection to the secretive and oppressive grand jury process. We are Chelsea’s friends and fellow organizers, and we know her as a person who is fully committed to her principles.”

They warned US authorities that if they “believe that subjecting Chelsea to more punishment will change her mind, they are gravely mistaken”.

Virginia prosecutors are determined to force Manning to testify in what they hope will be an eventual trial of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks.

Assange has been charged with conspiring with Manning to break into military computers to help her transmit a vast trove of US state secrets to the open information organization in 2010 which then published them, causing an international uproar.

Manning was subsequently sentenced to 35 years in military prison in 2011. Manning spent seven years behind bars before Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017.","Erwan Heussaff and Anne Curtis are both looking forward to parenthood as they share a stunning photoshoot that saw them go topless.

MANILA -- It's a popular template for those posting online on how they plan to approach 2020 -- comparing their pictures from the start of the decade to ones taken just before the end of it.

And Erwan Heussaff appeared to like the idea of looking back as he decided to use it to usher in the next chapter of his life as potential parents with wife, Kapamilya star Anne Curtis.

On New Year's Day, he shared a pair of photos -- one showing him carrying Curtis on his shoulders as they attended a music festival back in 2010, and another from a sexy pregnancy shoot.

""Started the decade partying it up at a music festival, ended it counting it down, just the two of us with virgin cocktails and starting the new one with another girl to carry on my shoulders,"" he wrote, referring to Curtis' pregnancy.

Curtis first announced that she was expecting back in November, and she's expected to give birth sometime in March.

She is also looking forward to life as a mother, flaunting her growing baby bump with her husband. The set also sees them both topless, with only Curtis' arms hiding her chest.

120,121,2019: Oregon International Air Show decamps for McMinnville,2019: Deputies wounded in shootout at Hagg Lake,"2019: Oregon International Air Show decamps for McMinnville

The air show left Hillsboro due to airport construction. It's supposed to return in 2021, but the format will change.

Editor's note: This story is part of the News-Times' special series, ""Decade in Review."" This series features three stories that helped to define each year of the 2010s. These can retell single stories that mattered to readers of the time, a saga that played out across many articles, and even stories that were crowded to the margins by other news at the time but have made a lasting impact on our region.

Since 1988, the Oregon International Air Show has been a Hillsboro tradition.

It's grown to be the largest civilian air show on the West Coast, according to organizers, and it's become a symbol — beloved by some, despised by others — of summertime in Hillsboro.

Well, until 2019, anyway.

Runway construction at the Hillsboro Airport prompted organizers to take their show on the road in 2019. For the first time ever, in September, the three-day air show was staged at McMinnville International Airport instead.

""There are a lot of 'firsts' this year,"" enthused Bill Braack, the Oregon International Air Show's president, ""unique things that we've never had.""

Although it was ongoing work at the Hillsboro Airport that forced the air show to relocate for 2019, the McMinnville location has a lot going for it, Braack said. One of the biggest is that Hillsboro and McMinnville have simply been on divergent courses in recent decades.

Fifty years ago, Hillsboro and McMinnville were about the size that Cornelius is today. Hillsboro was larger, with 15,365 residents, but McMinnville wasn't that far behind at 10,125.

The high-tech boom and urban outgrowth from Portland transformed Hillsboro. Today, the Washington County seat has an estimated population well over 100,000. McMinnville, the Yamhill County seat, has grown as well, but with an estimated population of about 35,000, it's gone from close behind Hillsboro in size to not even in the same league.

Hillsboro is also part of a growing Portland metro area, whereas McMinnville lies beyond its outskirts. It's not just the largest population center in western Yamhill County, it's the only major city.

""The feds love the new location, because the aerobatic box is clean — free from obstruction, no development, just farmland,"" Braack said.

Meanwhile, Hillsboro's relationship with the air show, and general aviation writ large, has been complicated. In neighborhoods beneath the Hillsboro Airport's flight pattern, yard signs decrying the airport aren't an uncommon sight. Public meetings about the airport routinely draw at least a small crowd to complain about the noise and air pollution.

""We … recognize that it's really quite a benefit for the Hillsboro community, and we also recognize that there are some community members and neighbors who may not appreciate it as much as others,"" said Port of Portland spokesperson Kama Simonds, referring specifically to the air show — although she could have just as easily been talking about the airport, which the Port owns and operates.

In light of all that, it was no surprise that rumors were flying for much of the year that the Oregon International Air Show would stay in McMinnville. And so it will, Braack confirmed in December 2019 — but organizers still want to bring some version of the air show back to Hillsboro starting in 2021.

Air shows are expensive to put on, and headline acts like the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, or the Royal Air Force Red Arrows, which performed in McMinnville this past September, are in high demand and can be difficult to book.

But Braack said organizers are confident they can stage air shows in both Hillsboro and McMinnville, beginning in 2021.

""We want the two events to be different so that there's reason for folks to come to one versus the other, or both,"" Braack told the News-Times in December.

Exactly what form those two events will take has yet to be announced. For now, though, the Oregon International Air Show is staying in McMinnville — organizers have already confirmed it will be held there, and not in Hillsboro, for a second straight year in 2020.","2019: Deputies wounded in shootout at Hagg Lake

A harrowing scene in the woods northeast of Gaston somehow didn't result in any deaths.

Editor's note: This story is part of the News-Times' special series, ""Decade in Review."" This series features three stories that helped to define each year of the 2010s. These can retell single stories that mattered to readers of the time, a saga that played out across many articles, and even stories that were crowded to the margins by other news at the time but have made a lasting impact on our region.

The official telling of what happened on Aug. 8, 2019, in the woods just north of Henry Hagg Lake reads like a white-knuckle scene in a war movie — or a horror movie.

The Washington County Tactical Negotiations Team was called out to Hagg Lake that afternoon after a resident called 9-1-1, saying a strange man stole two long guns from outside her house. TNT, as it's often called, is a multiagency tactical team that includes police officers from cities around Washington County. It's generally deployed in situations that are considered hazardous and high-risk — hostage situations, armed standoffs and the like.

As a TNT posse that included six Washington County sheriff's deputies, led by Sgt. John Crecelius, and police officers from Hillsboro and Tualatin searched the woods near the house for any sign of their armed suspect, shots rang out from the brush, according to the Washington County Sheriff's Office.

Deputy Chris Iverson was struck, but not seriously injured. Cpl. Jeremy Braun took the worst of the gunfire and went down.

Crecelius and the other law enforcement officers at the scene returned fire, the Sheriff's Office said, downing suspect Dante James Halling. As they contained the area and confirmed there was no active shooter, they radioed for medical attention.

Braun and Halling were rushed to local hospitals by LifeFlight helicopters with serious injuries. Iverson was taken by ground ambulance to the hospital.

More than a dozen agencies responded to the scene, including police and fire agencies from across Washington County and sheriff's deputies from nearby Yamhill County.

Iverson was treated and released from the hospital that evening, the Sheriff's Office said. Braun and Halling were hospitalized for several days before being discharged; Halling was immediately taken to the Washington County Jail, where he remains in custody on multiple felony charges, including attempted murder. A trial date has been set for April 21, 2020.

Unfortunately, the Hagg Lake shootout wasn't the only shooting involving law enforcement agents in western Washington County in 2019.

In September, a Hillsboro police officer fired a shot during a physical confrontation with a reportedly armed suspect at Extended Stay America; the bullet didn't strike the suspect, police said.

In October, under circumstances that remain somewhat fuzzy, a Hillsboro officer shot and killed a man in the west precinct parking lot. Police said the suspect brandished a handgun during an argument with another man in the parking lot and refused commands to put down his weapon.

All three incidents are being investigated by the Washington County District Attorney's Office, which is standard procedure whenever a law enforcement officer uses lethal force in the line of duty.",2.0,3.6666666666666665,3.0,3.6666666666666665,3.6666666666666665,1.0,3.333333333333333," The Oregon International Air Show has been a Hillsboro tradition since 1988 .

121,122,Harry Potter: The Actors Who Almost Played Dumbledore,Every Disney+ Movie & TV Show Releasing In 2020,"An impressive number of big-name actors were considered for the role of Albus Dumbledore in the Harry Potter film series based on the novels by J.K. Rowling. The Hogwarts Headmaster was originally played by Irish actor Richard Harris. After his untimely death following the second film, the studio was tasked with recasting the role. Michael Gambon was chosen as the replacement, portraying the character for the remainder of the films; however, there were other names on the list throughout both stages of casting the prominent role.

Albus Dumbledore served as Harry Potter's primary mentor during the young wizard's time at Hogwarts. Over time, Harry and his friends started to understand just how much influence Dumbledore had on the wizarding world. He was a half-blood wizard with immense powers and strength for leading through the toughest of times. Dumbledore founded the Order of the Phoenix and stood as a symbol of resistance following Lord Voldemort's second uprising. Even after the wizard's tragic death, Dumbledore's legacy lived on.

Not only did Warner Bros. and the team behind the film adaptations have a difficult task in casting a major role, but they had to do it multiple times. Dumbledore was just one of a small handful of characters to appear in every Harry Potter movie. Whoever was chosen for the role had to be available and dedicated to the role for the long-term. A few actors were considered before Harris acquired the role ahead of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Actor Patrick McGoohan reportedly had an interest in the role but stepped away from acting due to health reasons in the early 2000s. Sean Connery was also targeted but the actor was against the idea of committing to a children's movie about wizards. The list of ""could have been"" Dumbledore actors would grow in just a few years.

The Actors Considered When Dumbledore Was Recast

Following the actor's tragic passing in 2002, an even larger list of actors was rumored to be in line for his replacement. Christopher Lee was the producers' top choice in replacing Harris but he was forced to decline the offer due to scheduling conflicts. Harris' fellow Lord of the Rings veteran Ian McKellen was also considered. McKellen, however, expressed discomfort at the prospect of taking over the role of Dumbledore because Harris had previously criticized McKellen's acting style.

In addition, Peter O'Toole was reportedly considered but the studio worried that his age would become troublesome down the line. Acclaimed Indian actor, Naseeruddin Shah, has shared that his agent urged him to audition but he declined the opportunity. In the end, Gambon took over as Dumbledore which ended up becoming one of his best-known roles. It's always a tough task to replace an actor due to illness or death, but the studio successfully honored the original actor while giving the next stage of the role to an appreciative person. There's no doubt that some of the names mentioned above would have knocked the role out of the park in Harry Potter, but Gambon never took the chance of playing Dumbledore for granted.

123,124,Trump blames Iran after Iraqi militia storms US embassy in Baghdad over airstrikes,Iraq: Iran attacks US as Trump threatens repercussion,"Text Size: A- A+

Dubai: Dozens of Iraqi militiamen and their supporters stormed the U.S. Embassy complex in Baghdad on Tuesday to protest deadly U.S. airstrikes against their Iranian-backed force, as President Donald Trump blamed Tehran.

The Pentagon dispatched two AH-64 Apache helicopters to fly over the embassy in a show of force, and about 100 Marines already in the region will be sent to the compound to reinforce its defenses, a U.S. official said.

“We have taken appropriate force protection actions to ensure the safety of American citizens, military personnel and diplomats in-country, and to ensure our right of self-defense,” Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a statement.

The anti-American protesters remained outside the embassy compound into the night in Baghdad, as some set up tents suggesting they planned an extended sit-in, Al Jazeera reported.

Earlier, guards lobbed tear gas and opened fire to quell the unrest, which was quickly contained, though dozens of protesters remained outside the compound. The U.S. ambassador had departed two days earlier, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. The actual embassy building wasn’t attacked, he said.

Trump said in a tweet that Iran “will be held fully responsible” for the embassy assault as well the killing of an American contractor in Iraq that precipitated Sunday’s U.S. airstrikes against the Kataieb Hezbollah militia bases.

Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019

Trump followed up later with a tweet urging Iraqis to rise up against Iranian influence. “To those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don’t want to be dominated and controlled by Iran, this is your time!” he said.

The White House said Trump spoke with Iraq’s outgoing Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi about regional security, and the president “emphasized the need to protect United States personnel and facilities in Iraq.”

The rare direct U.S. assault on an Iranian proxy on Sunday claimed the lives of 25 fighters and came at an especially tense time and held the potential for escalation. The U.S. and Iran are locked in a standoff over the Trump administration’s crippling economic offensive against Tehran — meant to force it to renegotiate the 2015 nuclear deal Washington abandoned — and the Islamic Republic’s suspected reprisals.

Abbas Mousavi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, condemned in a statement “the shocking insolence” of U.S. officials who he said sought to blame his country for protests by Iraqis outraged over Americans “slaughtering at least 25 Iraqi people.”

The mob streamed into the embassy complex after climbing over blast walls and smashing down the outer gate and a guard post with hammers, according to televised footage. Black smoke billowed from tires the protesters set on fire. Dozens of protesters were hurt, some shot, others suffering from tear gas inhalation, according to a statement from the umbrella group to which Kataieb Hezbollah belongs.

Most of the protesters wore militia uniforms. Some hoisted militia flags as the crowd demanded that the embassy be shuttered and the ambassador expelled. “The embassy is closed by the order of the people,” someone scrawled on the blast walls. Other people spray-painted the word “resistance” on the barriers, and one protester was seen holding a headscarf with the image of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Mahdi, the outgoing prime minister, reiterated his denunciation of the U.S. raid on Tuesday but called on protesters to leave the compound, threatening severe penalties for attacks on the mission. – Bloomberg

Show Full Article","Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has said enemies were trying to drive a wedge between Tehran and Baghdad.

He said this in his condemnation of deadly U.S. airstrikes in Iraq, official IRNA news agency reported.

“I, together with the Iranian government and nation strongly condemn this evil act of America,” Khamenei was quoted as saying.

The U.S. strikes in Iraq and Syria on Sunday targeted the Kataib Hezbollah militia group, which was blamed for an attack last week that killed a U.S. citizen.

But the Iranian leader dismissed the U.S. officials’ claims that Iran was behind the anti-American moves in Iraq.

He said that the United States takes revenge on the Iraqi popular forces since they defeated the “Daesh,” also known as the Islamic State militants in Iraq.

Dozens of protesters set up camp outside the gates of the embassy on Wednesday, one day after thousands converged on Baghdad’s heavily fortified Green Zone to decry U.S. strikes that killed at least 25 militiamen.

Chanting “Death to America,” angry protesters on Tuesday broke into the U.S. embassy compound and set fire to one of its gates.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has blamed the attack on Iran and said the country will “pay a very big price.”

Trump spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdel-Mahdi by phone on Tuesday and “emphasised the need to protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq.”

Defense Secretary Mark Esper called on the government of Iraq to “fulfil its international responsibilities” to protect US citizens in the country.

However, the US it will immediately deploy 750 soldiers to Iraq “as an appropriate and precautionary action.”

125,126,20 Rose Parade moments to watch for in 2020,"Rose Parade 2020: Hope, history, diversity and a welcome return to normal","There’s what you’ll see — and what you hopefully won’t see — during Wednesday’s 2020 Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena.

Case in point: Drones.

The FBI on Tuesday issued a reminder to the public that the air space above Wednesday’s Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl is a “No Drone Zone,” calling for all drone enthusiasts to leave the mechanical flying camera critters at home for this event, citing the need for “safety of attendees.”

The Pasadena Police Department, which is leading security efforts on Wednesday, along with the FBI, will enforce federal laws covering unmanned aircraft, according to the FBI.

Anyone who does attempt to fly a drone stands a good chance of being arrested, prosecuted, fined and/or imprisoned, according to the FBI.

You also hopefully won’t have any surprises like last year, when the Chinese American Heritage Foundation’s “Harmony Through Union” stopped moving and smoke began erupting from it just before bend in the road where Orange Grove and Colorado boulevards meet.

Chinese American Heritage Foundation’s “Harmony Through Union” stopped moving and smoke began erupting from it just before bend in the road where Orange Grove and Colorado boulevards meet. It didn’t help that the first tow truck that attempted to move the float failed, and a second truck was needed to take the float to the end of the route. It wasn’t pretty.

But this year, parade officials put together new safety protocols and procedures float builders had to abide by to prevent another float fire. An investigation concluded the fire was most likely caused by an accidental discharge of transmission fluid onto the float’s exhaust pipe. The Tournament of Roses now requires float builders to install fire suppression measures similar to ones on buses, dispersing fire retardant powder in the event engines overheat, as well as fire barriers protecting driver compartments.

OK. Now, for the fun stuff that hopefully you will see.

Maybe you’re cozied up on the couch in your pjs with the TV on and a cup of joe or hot chocolate in reach. Maybe you’re bundled up on Colorado Boulevard, your face cool in the crisp morning Pasadena air.

Either way, we have a few suggestions on what to watch for in this year’s Tournament of Roses Parade. First off, note that this year’s parade theme is “The Power of Hope.”

So, fueled by that theme, organizers have created a parade event that really takes hold of the idea of rising up from adversity and tragedy but also mixed that with themes of healing and optimism as the decade kicks off. In that sense, all of the entries have a story to tell, and represent a part of the overall theme.

But, since there are 90 entries, and we’ve only got so many inches here — and a deadline — here are 20 or so moments to keep an eye on as you watch the 131st Rose Parade with that warm drink in your grasp. We tagged a number to the end, so you’ll see where it comes in the parade lineup. You can find all the acts listed in order here.

GET THIS PARTY STARTED

Rose Parade Opening Spectacular. Look for Ally Brooke, Emilio Estefan, Farruko and the Chino Hills High School Drumline (Parade Entry #1)

UP IN THE SKIES…

B-2 Spirit Flyover. The sight of that thing flying overhead as the event begins is just hard to ignore. Frankly, TV doesn’t do it justice. But you just gotta watch it. It sets quite the tone for the parade march — assuming you still have your hearing. (#2)

TERRIFIC TRIO

The grand marshals. It’s hard not to root for Rita Moreno and her co-grand marshals, Gina Torres and Laurie Hernandez. All represent generations of Latin American women who have climbed their own heights in stage and sport, and have inspired others in their journey. (#11)

ROYALS TIMES SEVEN

The Royal Court. How will Rose Queen Camille Kennedy and her court of Pasadena-area princesses stay warm for 5.5 miles? (#24)

MORNING OF HONOR

Pasadena City College Tournament of Roses Honor Band. Four musicians from Saugus High, who endured the trauma of the Nov. 14 fatal shootings on campus, were chosen to appear with this band. They called the experience a great honor and a great boost to their ability to cope with the tragedy. (#25)

WORTH YOUR VOTE

“Years of Hope. Years of Courage.” This is a really unique chance to be up close with a landmark moment — and history. This float pays homage to the struggle for women’s suffrage, celebrating 100 years of women voting. Riding on it will be civil rights giants and descendants of giants such as Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglas. (#26)

THE GRANDDADDY’S KIDS

Rose Bowl floats and bands. What would the parade be without a little pre-Rose Bowl fun — like a massive pep rally for Oregon and Wisconsin. Keep an eye out for Rose Bowl Game floats and bands. (#28, 29, 38 and 39)

LISTEN UP

Banda Municipal de Zarcero. Watching the marching bands live can be mesmerizing. They’re coming from all regions of the U.S. — from Pasadena to Mississippi. And from the world — from the Japan Honor Green Band to the Elsinore Girls Marching Band from Denmark. We recommend them all, but keep an eye — and an ear — out for this one, Banda, from Costa Rica. (#41)

THAT YOU, OLAF?

Halftime! LADIES and GENTLEMEN, BOYS AND GIRLS, HORSES AND SNOWMEN! A mid-parade performance of Disney’s “Frozen.” Let it gooooo! (#48)

YOU GO, GIRLS

Mid-America Cowgirls Rodeo Drill Team. The Rose Parade equestrian units are always a treat. They’ll all rock this year. The Cowgirls did just that (rocked it, that is) at the nearby Equestfest at the LA Equestrian Center in Burbank. (#55)

TINY BUT MIGHTY

Mini-Therapy horses. All together now: Awwwwww. Make sure the kids see this group. (#59)

MIGHTY AND MAMMOTH

Budweiser Clydesdales. Make sure the kids see this one, too. And they’re harder to miss! (#63)

SALVADORAN STRUT

Banda El Salvador: Grando Como Su Gente. That name translates roughly as “band as big as its people.” Rose Princess Mia Thorsen, whose family has roots in El Salvador, got to spend the day with performers from this band at Bandfest on Monday. (#77)

ROCKIN’ THE AGES

The Salvation Army Tournament of Roses band. It’s marched in the event for 100 years. (#83)

STORIES OF HOPE & LIFE

City of Hope and Donate Life floats. Stories of survival and sacrifice on these. (#83 and #84)

HOWLIN’ FINALE

Closing show: “Where Flowers and Football meet!” When Los Lobos performs, good things happen (#90).

—

The parade begins at 8 a.m. on Wednesday morning. But you knew that. It’ll be televised live.

You’re invited to keep up with us on Twitter, from our reporters in the field Wednesday @PasStarNews. And for tons more Rose coverage, read here.","Bannered under the theme “The Power of Hope,” the 2020 Rose Parade took flight on Wednesday, Jan. 1, helmed by its first Latina president and three Latina grand marshals, honoring 100 years of the right to vote for women and christened by a flyover by a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber piloted for the first time by a woman.

The parade enjoyed a welcome return to its usual carefree tone after the chaos of last year’s float fire puzzled paradegoers, left a handful of entries off the live broadcast and inspired months of investigation.

On Wednesday, only the usual minor issues were reported. Two unexpected entrants were noted, one tow truck to pick up a Tournament of Roses Hall of Fame fire engine that overheated near Mar Vista Avenue, and another to mop up a small oily mess the engine left behind.

Early predictions of rain and nasty wind never materialized. Instead, the parade welcomed the New Year on a postcard-perfect Pasadena day.

The verdict from the hundreds of thousands who lined the traditional route? “Better than last year,” agreed Pasadena residents Raquel Garcia and Alfonso Zavala, perched in prime viewing spots on Colorado Boulevard.

The Pasadena pair particularly enjoyed this year’s musical roster, which boasted more Latin-American bands than ever before. That wasn’t strategic, said Laura Farber, the Tournament of Roses’ first Latina president, with all the bands chosen solely on merit.

Among the brassy ensembles: Musicians from West Harrison High School, in Gulf Port, the first Mississippi band to perform in the parade in 30 years. Proud mom Mandy Geddings scurried about on the sidelines as the band trooped by, calling out to her daughter and snapping cell phone photos.

“That was amazing,” she said, gathering her breath. “It makes all those years and all that work of being a band parent all worth it.”

The Pasadena City College Honor Band marched through with four students from Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, who performed among 70-some other top Southern California student musicians. The four students were selected prior to the Nov. 14 shooting at the school but said marching in the parade helped them cope with the trauma spurred by the shocking campus attack.

“It was good to get back to being with people,” Saugus junior Jason Treanor said. “We could be social and not be stuck at home, dwelling on what happened.”

The band was bookended by the tournament’s beaming Royal Court and a float that proved to be 100 years in the making.

The seven-member court sat on a tiered float with Rose Queen Camille Kennedy sitting up high with the six princesses on the levels below. Kennedy, a self-described history buff and thespian, reveled in her role, taking a particular interest in the court’s volunteer work.

Following the Pasadena City College Honor Band came a float from Pasadena Celebrates 2020, adorned in such quotes as “Equal Rights for All” and “Lifting as We Climb” — all surrounding a mock Statue of Liberty and accompanied by a throng of suffragists. Titled “Years of Hope. Years of Courage,” the float celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.

The parade’s top honor for floats, the 2020 Sweepstakes Trophy, went to the UPS Store entry, “Stories Change Our World,” featuring whimsical monkeys and parrots set against a patch of of tropical trees.

While that float, and most others, were crafted by professionals, the Downey Rose Float Association took home the top award among the floats built by volunteers. Featuring a floral garden, a small pagoda and a bridge running over a river of blue roses, the float’s defining elements were large origami cranes.

Downey volunteers spent weeks folding 10,000 small paper cranes ahead of the event. They were ultimately distributed to nonprofits, according to a news release from the float’s sponsor, PIH Health.

For the first time, the parade featured a mid-parade “halftime show” with a live-action production number from Disney’s “Frozen.” Portraying such characters as Anna, Elsa and Olaf, the performance featured players from the production currently on stage at the Hollywood Pantages, just a few months before the Los Angeles-based crew takes its show on the national road, a spokeswoman for the tournament said.

The elaborate performance was one of three major musical moments in the parade. Also included:

The Rose Parade Opening Spectacular, starring Ally Brooke, Emilio Estefan, Farruko, myriad dancers and the Chino Hills High School Drumline. They performed an original choreographed song, “Reach for the Stars.”

The parade’s closing show, “Where Flowers and Football Meet!” featured a song from Los Lobos and American Idol alum Alejandro Aranda, also known as Scarypoolparty.

Legendary 88-year-old actress Rita Moreno — one of three grand marshals, all Latinas chosen by Farber — proved a crowd favorite as she energetically danced her way down Colorado Boulevard in the back of a historic car. Some declared her a “a national treasure.”

Fans also sung the praises of her two co-marshals, actress Gina Torres and Olympic gold medalist Laurie Hernandez.

“We thought we had a fantastic parade today,” Tournament of Roses Chief Executive David Eads said. He lauded the floats and the musical performances, as well as the unbeatable weather.

There were no arrests during the parade itself, police said and only three people were cited for drunken behavior the night before. That’s down from last year’s seven citations.

“There were no issues at all,” Lt. Pete Hettema of the Pasadena Police Department said “As far as law enforcement, we had a good day.”",1.0,1.3333333333333333,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0," The FBI issued a reminder to the public that the air space above Wednesday’s Rose Parade and the Rose Bowl is a “No Drone Zone” Anyone who does attempt to fly a drone stands a good chance of being arrested, prosecuted, fined and/or imprisoned .

126,127,Sexual abuse of children often involves those close to home – Mon News Agency,"Fox News Host Warns: If You Aren’t Teaching Your Kids About Freedom, You Aren’t Doing your Job as a Parent","Reported by: Akka Non

In Mon State, the sexual abuse of children often involves family members or those who are close to the child’s family, according to Daw Khaing Khaing Leh, Chair of the Mon State Parliament’s Women’s and Children’s Rights Committee.

“70 percent of a child rape cases [involve] those who are familiar to the children while a stranger is very rare. It is very difficult for a stranger to take a child out of school and put the child on a motorcycle or a car. The children will immediately react or shout if they are approached by strangers. Often [sexual abuse cases] happen when perpetrators are close to a child so that it is easy for the child to be convinced,” she said.

According to the data, children between the ages of 7 to 13 are more vulnerable to abuse. Perpetrators are often an uncle or a father. Daw Khaing Khaing Leh pointed out that in the past, people had limited knowledge of where to make a report or where to ask for help. For this reason, the prevalence of child sexual abuse was not well known or documented.

Social stigmas regarding persons who have experiened sexual abuse, sexual violence and/or harassment discourages most children and women who are the victims, to disclose or report their experiences.

“When we talk about domestic violence, it includes physical and sexual violence as well as psychological violence. Violence against children is now increasing. Child sexual abuse is becoming more common in our society,” according to Mi Ah Mon Bloa, a participant of a 16-day eliminating gender-based violence awareness campaign.

According to the Chair of the Mon State Parliament Women and Children rights Committee, more than 30 educational sessions called “Body Prevention Awareness” have been conducted at different schools in Mon State.

From January to November 2019, 69 out of 90 rape cases involved children in Mon State. In 2018 the number of reported cases involving sexual abuse of children was 57, according to the Mon State Police office.

Looking for a New Year’s resolution? Talk to your kids about capitalism versus socialism and Communism.

“The blame shouldn’t be on universities, although they’re certainly doing their part indoctrinating our kids,” Fox News host Rachel Campos-Duffy said on the Todd Starnes Show. “As parents, we are failing our children.”

Campos-Duffy said parents must fight back against left wing indoctrination by educating their children around the dinner table and in the car. Click here to listen to the entire interview.

“If you are not talking about Socialism and Communism versus Capitalism, if you’re not talking about opportunity, if you’re not talking about the kind of religious liberty and personal free speech liberty that you will lose under Socialism, the kind of political repression that you see under Socialism and Communism and the poverty that it has always ended up bringing to any country that allows itself to fall into it, you’re not doing your job as a parent.”

You’re also not doing your job as a Christian, she stressed.

“Communism and socialism are atheistic, anti-religion ideologies, and so we as parents have to do a better job.”

A disturbing survey released by the Victims of Communism Memorial Fund showed a dramatic increase in the number of millennials who favor Communism.

The survey found 36 percent of Millennials (people ages 23 to 38) approve of Communism. That’s up from 28 percent in 2018. Meanwhile, 70 percent of Millennials surveyed say they are likely to vote socialist.

SATURN-PLUTO CONJUNCTION: GROW UP AND GET REAL

The long-awaited Saturn-Pluto conjunction in Capricorn arrives January 12. The astro-blogosphere's scare tactics trigger the fear factor, ominously hinting at international power clashes, constrictive structural and societal pressures around issues of borders and boundaries, and the powerful versus the powerless via this heavy, intense transit. Regardless of the global implications of the meeting of the cosmic timekeeper, Saturn, with raw, ruthless power-player Pluto, this transit need not inspire fear or dread if we accept that the purpose of change is to develop maturity. Growing up, getting real, and accepting personal responsibility is only scary if one has no role model for successful adulting. This month provides celestial parenting on a grand scale.

Maturity means accepting reality in all its messy ambiguity and imperfection. Good parents prepare their children to face reality. The ""parents"" here are the Full Moon/Lunar Eclipse in Moon-ruled Cancer, opposite the Sun, Saturn and Mercury in Capricorn January 10. Light, symbolic of consciousness, is darkened during an eclipse. When the Moon is re-revealed, she allows us to see our truth in a new, realistic, unromanticized light. With the Sun, Saturn, Pluto, Jupiter, and the South Lunar Node all in Capricorn now, that light reveals the shouldering of adult responsibility, the acceptance of hard work and personal sacrifice in order to nurture growth, nest a domestic environment, enhance emotional security and preserve ancestral heritage and family values.

The square of the Sun to Uranus January 22 portends shakeups in the hierarchal status quo. New Moon in Aquarius January 24 with Neptune's conjunction to Venus January 26 and square to Mars January 28 reveal the genuine. Authenticity's value skyrockets.

(Sophie Heizer/News Staff)

Freshly elected first-time Saanich Community Association Network (SCAN) Chair Don Gunn said the hub for local community groups will tackle the issue of housing in the new year.

Gunn and Vice-Chair Eric Dahli were elected to chair the network of associations on Dec. 4. They will chair the network into the new year. They said Saanich Mayor Fred Haynes is scheduled to speak to the group about the direction they’re going in March 2020.

“Some of the things we’re going to be looking at include how we handle developments, affordable housing and how it impacts communities, infill housing, garden suites, and looking at using institutional land for housing,” Gunn said.

Gunn said densifying housing in the area is inevitable. “We’re going to densify, it’s just a matter of trying to maintain the character of the community at the same time,” Gunn said.

Dahli and Gunn said they’d like to see the associations attract more young people. They encourage people, especially young people, to get involved with their local community association.

“The majority of our members are retired, which is great because they bring a lot of experience, but we need more young people,” Gunn said.

“All the associations try to attract new and younger members. We aim for a balance, and a gender balance, because we want to reflect the community,” Dahli said.

“Each community association is a voice unto itself, we don’t speak for all the associations and we have no statutory power, we’re really about sharing information between the associations and we liaise with the Victoria Community Association Network too,” Dahli said. “The nice thing about us is we’re recognized by Saanich Council and they give us some funding, which is non-existent elsewhere.”

If you're not following Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers on Twitter, what in the heck are you waiting for? When he's not firing off touchdowns to Davante Adams on Sundays, AR12 is beyond entertaining on social media.

Fans have grown used to seeing him have some awesome back and forth interactions with the account 'Shooter McGavin', which of course is from the Happy Gilmore movie. Well, on New Year's Eve, Shooter came after Rodgers again and the star QB put him in his place.

Take that, Shooter!

While Rodgers hasn't looked as sharp as usual in recent weeks, he still powered Green Bay to a 13-3 record, the No. 2 seed in the NFC and a first-round BYE in the playoffs. Yup, he had another strong year, no doubt.

As this decade comes to a close... my favorite #Packers memory from 2010-2019, was winning Super Bowl XLV. ?

For now, he'll be able to rest up until the conference semifinals, where the Pack will host a game at what's expected to be a fired up Lambeau Field. Until then, it'd be wise for McGavin to stay away from Rodgers. Unless he wants more fire sent his way, of course.","Little Marquis Johnson Jr.’s timing couldn’t have been better.

Little Marquis Johnson Jr.’s timing couldn’t have been better.

The 6-pound, 19-inch boy was brought into this world at 37 seconds after midnight Wednesday — New Year’s Day — at Sunrise Children’s Hospital. This means little Marquis is believed to be the first baby born in Las Vegas not just in 2020, but also in the new decade.

“They were like, ‘It’s 12!’” Marquis’ mother, Latasha Atkinson, said from her hospital room. “I was like, ‘Oh my God!’ We were thinking it already because were were like it would be so cool if we had a New Year’s baby … we didn’t think it was really going to happen.’”

Marquis’ father, Marquis Johnson Sr., was, of course, thrilled to have a brand-new son — and to also know the baby made history in Las Vegas.

“She was like, ‘Maybe, maybe,’ and so she probably spoke it into existence,” Marquis Johnson Sr. said of the timing of his son’s birth.

Atkinson said she can’t wait to tell her son about his arrival time into this world as he gets older.

“It is cool … really cool,” she said. “That’s something like, when he grows up, we are going to tell him.”

“’You were the first decade baby!’” Johnson Sr. chimed in. “That’s going to be an amazing thing. He’s going to have all the bragging rights … ‘I’m a superstar!’ ”

Cyndi Lundeberg, spokeswoman for the hospital, said doctors and staffers were excited for the family as well.

“It is super exciting any time we have a new baby at the hospital — everyone we have, our doctors, our staff, are extremely excited,” she said. “But, to have the first baby of the decade at Sunrise is truly amazing and we could not be happier for our lovely parents.”

The Las Vegas couple said they can’t wait to get Marquis Jr. home to meet his two siblings.

“Nothing but happiness,” Atkinson said.

To celebrate the birth, the family received a baby stroller “full of goodies,” including baby supplies and onesies, Lundeberg said in a later email.

A second baby was born 21 seconds after Marquis at MountainView Hospital, according to Lundeberg, who is director of marking and communications for Southern Hills Hospital and Medical Center.

That baby, Roman Black, was born 58 seconds after midnight. He weighs 5 pounds, 4 ounces, and is 19 inches long. His parents are Marie Buckley and Lorenzo Black.

130,131,,'Are you crazy?' Dorchester celebrates New Year's Day with annual polar bear dip,"Last year, Kate Dooley set off a 10-inch firework, perhaps her biggest yet, said Kim Smale, a close friend of Yellowknife's fireworks maestro.

""The anticipation for that one was just huge. You could just watch Kate vibrate as she was ready to flick the switch on that one,"" said Smale.

Dooley loved to watch things explode in the sky. If you've watched fireworks on New Year's Eve, the opening of the Deh Cho bridge, the Tłı̨chǫ self-government signing, or the Long John Jamboree, you've likely seen her work.

It's the first New Year's Eve in 15 years that she won't be behind the fuse. Dooley passed away from an illness in early December.

This year, the folks running the New Year's fireworks show will set off a few explosives just for her. And, she had favourites.

""The big shells and the big chrysanthemums that burst over the sky — I mean, they were always good. But you know the ones that just kinda keep firing from the bottom? She liked those too because they were a rapid fire kind of show,"" said Smale.

Dooley was a house painter and a dog lover. She worked at mining camps. She liked metal music and Etta James. She was a private person who spent time at her camper and in the outdoors with Smale's dogs.

When she passed sooner than expected this winter, one of her fireworks crew mates, Terrel Hobbs, stepped up to carry on the show as a fireworks supervisor.

""Every New Year's show for the last 15 years we've done together,"" said Hobbs.

At the start of the show, Hobbs and his crew planned to set off some patriot missiles in her memory.

""We'll take a brief moment in memory and reflection of Kate and the amount of work she put into the shows,"" he said.

Hobbs would see her for just a few days out of the year, but when she would call him up to say the fireworks were on their way, her excitement was unmistakable, said Hobbes.

""Any time that someone's going to pay you to blow up stuff, it's always very exciting, and I think it was definitely a time of year that she really enjoyed,"" he said.

Dooley got endorsements to shoot up to a 10 or 12 inch firework. The team works in all conditions and lights the fireworks manually.

The crew on the ground is close enough to feel the boom, said Hobbs.

""I think for Katie it was probably the bigger the better,"" he said.

Dooley would start preparing around November, making sure people could see the show from wherever they were, said Smale.

""You know just listening to the people afterwards talking about whether they enjoyed it or what they saw out of it, that was that was really huge for Kate,"" she said.

This year, the New Year's Eve Fireworks are ""bittersweet,"" said Smale.

""The end kind of happened quite quickly. You kind of wish she was here doing it, as she normally did every year. But I know that she's going to be watching.""","'Are you crazy?' Dorchester celebrates New Year's Day with annual polar bear dip

If you're feeling a little worse for wear after a rawkus New Year's Eve, you probably couldn't find a more thrilling way to wake up than a polar dip.

The Dorchester & District Lions Club held its 27th annual polar dip today in the small village about 40 kilometres southeast of Moncton.

Dan Matthews, one of the event's organizers, said the tradition was started by a few friends one New Year's Day close to three decades ago. He said it was probably imbued with a little liquid courage.

""There is a rumour that there might or might not have been some alcohol involved in the process,"" said Matthews.

""The boys got together on New Year's Day and thought it'd be neat to cut a hole in the ice at Palmer's Pond and jump in the water.""

The founders of the dip have continued on since 1994, although one of them missed a year.

""He used the paltry excuse that he had pneumonia or something,"" said Matthews.

Dipping for a cause

The polar bear dip is an annual event held worldwide, generally to help raise money for different organizations.

In Dorchester, money is raised for the local Boys and Girls Club.

Of course, the task is a little more gruelling in colder climates.

This year people taking the plunge had it easy, with a balmy daytime high of 1 C.

But Matthews said there have been dips conducted at -20 C. When that happens, dippers don't stay in the water too long because of the risk of frost bite.

""People usually make a run for the vehicle and get in the shelter,"" said Matthews.

What to wear?

Swim trunks and bikinis are the most popular attire for the annual dip.

But Matthews said some people go a little extra step and show up dressed to impress.

""We have one lady ... the first time she showed up, she showed up in her wedding dress,"" said Matthews.

""She even brought along her maids of honour in full regalia and they jumped in.""

But not everyone is keen on jumping into freezing waters, including Matthews himself.

CHICAGO — Chicago’s Jewish community came together Sunday evening in Old Orchard for a vigil in the wake of Saturday’s attacks in New York.

The recent violence has traumatized the Jewish community in New York and New Jersey and it’s hitting home here, too. there have been a string of incidents in recent weeks but the message tonight on the last evening of Hanukkah — be the light.

A 38-year-old man broke into the home of a rabbi Saturday evening night in New York and stabbed 5 Hasidic Jews. Everyone survived, mostly likely because they fought back.

A vigil was held Sunday to stand against anti-Semitism. It was also a chance to light the menorah on the eighth day of Hanukkah and take a stand.

Jewish communities around the country are banding together in peace and solidarity to raise a clear moral voice against what’s been happening in the country and to stand together against hatred and anti-Semitism by spreading light.

""Here we are again. Two weeks ago it was NJ and last night of course this additional tragedy. And then the Hanukkah lights remind us that our capacity to outshine darkness with light to increase acts of goodness and kindness...and that even a little light can dispel a lot of darkness,"" Rabbi Baruch Epstein said.

“It’s so important that we stand tall and proud and tell the world what goodness means,"" Rabbi Yochanan Posner said.

The lit menorah is a reminder of the crisis of silence, and why standing together is not a choice, but an imperative.","""The community is in shock. There's a lot of fear and anxiety, but that's why it's really important for organizations like ADL and broader community to step up and be allies.""

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday outside the rabbi's house that he considers the attack to be ""domestic terrorism"" and would introduce a law that would label anti-Semitic attacks as such.

""Let's call it what it is. These people are domestic terrorists. And the law should reflect that, and they should be punished as if it was an act of terrorism.

The big picture: Segal noted that New York City saw a 17% increase in anti-Semitic incidents from January to November of this year compared to last year. He attributed the rise in part to the ""mainstreaming"" of anti-Semitism on social media.

Context: The stabbings followed a string of attacks targeting Jews in the region, including a massacre at a kosher grocery store in New Jersey on Dec. 10.

Over the weekend, the NYPD had beefed up patrols in Brooklyn neighborhoods with large Jewish populations after a string of anti-Semitic attacks during Hanukkah, per AP.

Besides making officers more visible in Borough Park, Crown Heights and Williamsburg, police will boost visits to houses of worship and other places.

The Guardian Angels, a private, unarmed crime-prevention group, said it would begin patrolling Jewish neighborhoods following the attacks, saying the police are not doing enough.

133,134,NTPC offers sops to keep Andhra from revoking contracts,Andhra Pradesh deputy CM posts TikTok video praising CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy,"NEW DELHI : In an attempt to broker a truce with Andhra Pradesh over its decision to relook at renewable energy contracts, state-run NTPC Ltd has offered to buy 300MW of green power from the cash-strapped state.

The sweetener was offered to prevent Andhra Pradesh from renegotiating power purchase agreements inked by the previous state government.

Scrapping or renegotiating contracts could potentially deter foreign investors and hurt India’s ability to attract overseas investments amid slowing economic growth.

The offer to buy electricity at “mutually agreed rates"" was made by NTPC chairman Gurdeep Singh to the state government led by chief minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at a meeting in November.

“We are trying to ready a solution. The Andhra Pradesh government has been offered sweeteners,"" a senior Union government official said on condition of anonymity.

Queries emailed to the spokespeople of NTPC and the Union ministry of new and renewable energy on Tuesday evening remained unanswered.

Andhra has India’s second-largest installed capacity of clean energy, accounting for around 10% of the country’s renewable energy capacity, with investments of around ₹60,000 crore.

State energy secretary N. Srikanth confirmed the development. “We are yet to receive a formal proposal. Once we get it we will take a decision,"" he said.

The state has around 7,700MW of solar and wind power projects. It has 4,092MW of installed wind power projects awarded through feed-in tariffs, and 3,230MW of solar power projects awarded through competitive bidding. Andhra owes ₹20,000 crore to all power generators in unpaid bills.

NTPC plans to use the electricity bought from Andhra Pradesh to bundle it with power generated from its stations to bring tariffs down.

According to government documents reviewed by Mint, “NTPC may buy renewable power from Andhra Pradesh for bundling scheme of government of India at an appropriate price.""

The Union government has been trying to seek a solution to the issue, given that marquee investors such as Goldman Sachs, Brookfield, SoftBank and World Bank’s International Finance Corp. have invested in the state’s clean energy projects. Mint reported on 29 November about a compromise formula struck during a meeting attended by Union and state government representatives on 7 November. However, the hard-fought compromise floundered.","Amaravati: Andhra Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister P. Pushpa Sreevani has posted her selfie video on TikTok for a song praising Chief Minister Y.S.

Sreevani herself posed for the video with the Telugu song ‘Rayalaseema muddubidda mana Jagan Anna’ in the background. The selfie video of 33-year-old woman leader has gone viral on the social media.

Though Sreevani belongs to north coastal Andhra, she posted her video with a song, praising him for development of Rayalaseema.

Sreevani, who is a minister for tribal welfare, posted the TikTok video amid ongoing row over Jagan’s three-capital proposal, which has angered farmers in the present capital Amaravati.

Jagan has mooted Visakhapatnam (in north coastal Andhra) as administrative capital and Kurnool (in Rayalaseema) as judicial capital.

More foldable smartphones and a new generation of games consoles are likely to be among the biggest new gadgets of 2020.

Here is a look at what to expect over the coming 12 months in the world of technology.

A 5G iPhone

While some manufacturers have been quick to introduce 5G smartphones even as the network coverage only begins to appear, Apple is yet to bring the connectivity to the iPhone.

Many believe this will change in 2020, with a 5G iPhone introduced alongside a number of other iPhone handsets.

It would be seen as a watershed moment for the technology by some - Apple's status as a brand means that innovation is not always considered mainstream until the Cupertino firm is involved.

By the time a 5G iPhone arrives - likely to be in September - 5G coverage should be far wider than it is currently - wide enough that Apple feels it is time to add the connectivity to its smartphone.

The new console wars

2020 looks likely to be one of the biggest and most important years in the video games industry for some time.

Not only is cloud streaming taking off, allowing console-standard gaming on mobile devices, but both Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation will launch their next-generation consoles in time for next Christmas.

The Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 have both been confirmed, complete with high-end specs which both say will make them the most powerful consoles either firm has ever made.

It will be a redrawing of the battle lines for the two biggest names in gaming, as they compete to set the standard for the next generation of video games.

More foldable phones

As 2019 draws to a close, only Samsung of the major smartphone makers has a foldable device on sale in the UK - expect that to drastically change in 2020.

Samsung itself has already hinted at new types of foldable phones which could be on the way, while Motorola's revamped, foldable Razr will also become available.

Huawei's Mate X has gone on sale in China, but could 2020 see it or another Huawei foldable make it to Europe?

A number of smaller firms are also likely to try and break the status quo too - some of which could choose to reveal themselves during the CES trade show in Las Vegas, early in the new year.

Microsoft's Surface Duo and Neo

Not quite fully-fledged foldables, but Microsoft's Surface Duo and Surface Neo will make their debut in 2020, attempting to be a new type of mobile device.

Both gadgets have two screens bound together by a hinge and can fold into a number of positions. Both are due to go on sale at the end of 2020.

The Duo is smartphone-sized, while the Neo is closer to that of a laptop or tablet - however, Microsoft is adamant neither should be considered as part of those categories.

In much the same way the tech giant's Surface helped create the ""two-in-one"" category of tablet combined with laptop, Microsoft hopes the Duo and Neo can change how people use their devices every day.","Every big company is going to release something noteworthy in 2020, but all we've are got is rumors and dreams to work with right now.

That's not going to stop us from speculating about the potential for revolutionary tech. Think beyond brighter screens, better cameras, and other incremental changes. These are things we expect to see in 2020 that could really shake things up.

Affordable 5G phones and more expansive networks

By now, you probably at least know what mobile 5G is. Carriers like Verizon are already advertising their 5G networks on TV, even though very few devices even support it in the cities where it's available. The worst part is you can't really get a 5G-compatible phone for less than $1,000 right now.

That isn't guaranteed to change next year, but it seems more likely than not. More companies (we're looking at you, Apple) will hop on the bandwagon, production will be streamlined, and fingers crossed, 5G phones will be slightly more affordable. With networks expanding, it might finally make sense to own a 5G phone by the end of 2020.

That blazing fast speed could enable some wild new habits. People could start downloading entire seasons of TV shows off Netflix in minutes on their phones, all while they're walking around outside. New types of online mobile gaming could be enabled, too, if developers can trust that more people are near super-fast mobile networks.

And now for the really fun part: The tech that powers 5G networks could interfere with weather satellites, making it harder to get accurate forecasts in an era of climate change and powerful natural disasters. Cool!

PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X

Xbox Series X isn't doing much in the looks department, but it could be extremely powerful under the hood. Image: Microsoft

By the time we get to the next holiday season, it will have been seven years since the last new PlayStation and Xbox consoles launched. The PS4 Pro and Xbox One X were powerful revisions, sure, but they didn't enable any new experiences. They just made existing experiences a little better.

Details are still pretty scarce, but the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have both been officially announced for holiday 2020. Sony has been a little more forthright with specs, confirming the PS5 will come with a solid state drive, a first for game consoles. In layman's terms, that little hard drive means that games could significantly reduce, or even maybe eliminate, load times.

If you play console games, think about how much time you spend waiting for things to load. Imagine not having to do that anymore. Sounds nice, right? Aside from that nice quality-of-life boost, it could enable developers to design bigger, more immersive worlds that players can navigate in a flash.

Aside from that, the PS5 will let you choose to install just single player or multiplayer portions of games. Meanwhile, the new Xbox will let you suspend multiple games at once. Nifty.

Another little bonus: The PS5 will play 4K Blu-Ray discs, something the Xbox One X already does. Those of us who like physical media more than streaming can now bask in the knowledge that tens or hundreds of millions of people will have UHD Blu-Ray players in their homes.

VR hand tracking

If 2019 was the year real VR became financially accessible, 2020 could be the year that accessibility extends to pure usability thanks to two little words: Hand tracking.

Up until now, high-end VR contraptions have required the use of motion controllers to interact with objects in the digital realm. The Oculus controllers, for example, work well enough and are pretty comfortable, but they're not for everybody. It can be a little disorienting for newcomers to be immersed in a virtual world without the ability to use their actual hands for things.

Oculus Quest hand tracking is already available as an early-access software update, but it should expand in 2020 to support more apps and games. Take a look at one example of how it works:

Looks nice, right? Poking at things with your real digits is a lot more intuitive than relying on a proprietary controller. It's what VR always should have been, but understandably couldn't be until the technology was there.

If Oculus and other VR manufacturers are able to nail hand tracking in 2020, it could open up a whole new world of design possibilities for VR experiences.

Microsoft Surface Duo/Neo

Funky! Image: Microsoft

We saw a decent amount of foldable tech in 2019, but none of it really made a splash aside from dominating Twitter for a day or two. Samsung's Galaxy Fold failed to justify itself even in the more functional second revision, while Motorola's new foldable Razr revival is still a wild card.

Microsoft, on other hand, caught our attention back in October with the announcement of two devices that might fulfill the foldable promise without actually using foldable screens. The Surface Neo tablet and Surface Duo phone use dual touch screens to potentially give users tons of real estate, without the fear of a foldable screen going haywire.

You might be able to watch Netflix on one screen while chatting with a friend or writing emails on the other. Dragging elements between screens looked pretty intuitive and seamless at Microsoft's reveal event, but since we didn't get our hands on either device at the time, we can't promise they work as intended.

If Microsoft is able to make them work and put together a solid sales pitch, it could start a new trend that other phone and tablet makers follow.

Or it could be a miserable, hilarious failure. That would be fun in its own way.

Cloud gaming

Google Stadia's early access launch wasn't ideal, but cloud gaming will only get bigger in 2020. Image: google

Back on the gaming front, big name companies like Microsoft and Google figure internet infrastructure in the United States is good enough to launch game streaming services. Yes, with the recently sort-of-launched Google Stadia and the forthcoming Microsoft xCloud, you can stream video games over the internet without spending hundreds on powerful hardware.

It's ambitious because video games, unlike TV shows and movies, require constant user inputs to work. Those inputs need to be responsive, which is a problem when you factor in internet latency. Microsoft and Google are confident in their tech, but we'll need to wait and see what happens when it's in the hands of as many people as possible.

Cloud gaming feels like a boom-or-bust proposition. If it works, you might see some people decide not to buy those beefy new consoles we talked about earlier because they can play high-end games in a web browser or on a Chromecast for way less money. The downside of this is that you don't really own anything you buy in a streamed marketplace, and if these services ever shut down, the games could be gone forever.

It could also be a complete dumpster fire because the internet, frankly, sucks in large swaths of the U.S. If someone plugs in an Xbox and shoves a disc into the drive, it's guaranteed to be playable. That guarantee doesn't necessarily exist with cloud gaming, and some people might swear it off entirely because of that.

Again, it's possible none of these consumer tech gadgets and trends change a darn thing in the long run. But the fun lies in the possibility. New (or new-ish) ideas are always more interesting than another new phone with a better camera, even if they don't stick the landing.",1.0,1.6666666666666667,1.0,1.6666666666666667,1.6666666666666667,1.0,1.0, Microsoft's Surface Duo and Neo will make their debut in 2020 .

135,136,A startup sector slowdown in 2020 could be unexpectedly bad news for the tech giants,5 homicides in first hours of 2020 in St. Louis,"If the startup sector cools off in 2020 it could be bad news for tech giants.

Bank of America analyzed six key startups that IPO'd in 2019 and found that the growth of their total ad spend is rapidly dropping.

If this is representative of the broader startup ecosystem, it could mean Facebook and Google will start to lose an easy source of revenue growth.

Click here for more BI Prime stories.

A slowdown in the startup sector in 2020 might not just be bad news for entrepreneurs and investors — it may also throw an unexpected wrench into Facebook and Google's businesses.

A report published by Bank of America analysts earlier this month makes the case that the markets' rough treatment of newly-public startups could — if it continues next year — translate into a broad slowdown in ad spending by startups. That, in turn, could crimp revenue for the advertising-based business which rely on those startups.

The report underscores the interconnectedness of the modern tech sector, and how events in one corner can ripple out and affect the broader market in unpredictable ways.

To make its case, BofA analysts took six major startups that IPO'd in 2019 — ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft, social network Pinterest, fashion company RealReal, fitness company Peloton, and pet food retailer Chewy — and looked at their ad spend as a percentage of their total revenue.

On average, this dropped over the last 12 months — from 28% in 2018 to 24% expected for 2019. The financial services firm anticipates it'll drop again next year, down to 22% in 2020.

""If this deceleration in ad spend is reflective of start-up sector,"" the analysts wrote, ""Facebook and Google could see an unanticipated slowdown in ad spend in 2020.""

Of course, that's not guaranteed. The six startups identified may not be truly representative of the broader ecosystem, and the disappointing IPO results that the industry did see in 2019 may not be repeated in 2020.

BofA also doesn't attempt to precisely quantify the size of the hit Google and Facebook will take, but it will by no means be ruinous. All six companies are modeled to continue to grow their total sales and marketing spend year-on-year from now through the end of 2021, albeit at successively slower rates.

But what it does mean is that an easy growth engine for the advertising giants is at the risk of drying up — an unanticipated complication that may frustrate investors' insatiable hunger for growth, and force Facebook and Google to think harder about future sources of revenue.

It would not be the first time that trouble with startups affected more established tech companies that had become reliant on the free-spending startup customers. During the dotcom boom two decades ago, Oracle and SAP saw business boom as a wave of young startups snapped up their products in a frenzied race to build websites. When those startups' businesses proved unviable and the startups failed, the big tech companies lost an important source of revenue and were forced to readjust their own operations.

136,137,Why This Indian State Is Witnessing the Country's Most Violent Anti Citizenship-Law Protests,India celebrates New Year's Eve with protests against citizenship law,"On Wednesday, cries of “kagaz nahin dikhayenge” (we wont show papers), “Tanasahi nahin chalegi” (we won’t allow dictatorship) rang out at the iconic India Gate in Delhi as protesters took a pledge to defend the constitution and continue to oppose Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s new citizenship law. Thousands of Indians brought in the New Year on Tuesday night with protests all over the country. Social media buzzed with protest notes and invitations to demonstrations at midnight. One note from the women of the Shaheen Bagh neighborhood in South Delhi — who have been holding a nonstop 17-day protest — invited people to join them for biryani, tea and protest songs and slogans to bring in the new year and “salute the fallen heroes in the struggle against this fascist regime, in Kashmir, in Assam, in Uttar Pradesh, in Karnataka, hit by police brutality in all corners of the country” and “to mark the first nationwide revolution for a new secular India.”

Anti-government protests had been brewing across India since almost 2 million people were stripped of their citizenship in the northeastern state of Assam earlier this year as part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government’s National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise that makes it mandatory for all Indians to provide certain documents to prove citizenship.

That was followed by the Modi government’s move to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), passing a bill on Dec. 11 that offers a fast track to Indian citizenship for non-Muslim refugees from the neighboring countries of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh — specifically Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians who arrived in India before 2014. Protesters say that by granting citizenship to these communities but discriminating against Muslims, Modi’s Hindu nationalist government is undermining India’s secular constitution.

In response, tens of thousands of Indians have taken to the streets of Indian cities, in what marks the first serious opposition to the Modi administration since he took office in 2014. The protests grew after Dec. 15, when Delhi Police stormed into one of India’s oldest Muslim-majority universities — Jamia Millia Islamia — to curb student protests. A few hours later, police in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, cracked down on the Aligarh Muslim University, another Muslim majority university. After images of the crackdown on students at Jamia and Aligarh University started surfacing, the protests exploded. More than 1,100 people have been arrested so far and over 5,558 kept in preventive detention.

Together with the NRC, critics say the citizenship law is part of a broader plan by Modi’s party to expel Muslims. “We had to be here,” a young female student told TIME at an emergency protest in central Delhi on Dec 15. As police officers pushed against them with their riot gear, she stood holding hands with her peers in a human chain. “We are here in solidarity with the students and with everyone else in this country. We cannot be silent anymore.”

While much of India has been roiled by protests in the last three weeks, the violence has been particularly bad in Uttar Pradesh, where an estimated 19 people have died. The northern state is home to more than 200 million people, 19% of whom are Muslims. In cities across the state — from Lucknow to Meerut to Kanpur to Bijnor to Varanasi — there has been a constant stream of videos and reports of illegal detention, arrests on false charges, open firing on peaceful protesters, arson and looting by the police.

The state is ruled by Hindu monk Yogi Adityanath from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Appointed the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2017, the 47-year-old — in his saffron robe, shaved head, and crimson mark on his forehead — unapologetically represents the interests of a Hindu state. In 2002, he founded a Hindu youth militia, headquartered in his constituency. The group, which describes itself as “a fierce cultural and social organization dedicated to Hindutva and nationalism,” was charged by the police for inciting riots, arson and murder in Mau in eastern Uttar Pradesh in 2005.

Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh state Yogi Adityanath celebrates the party's victory in Lucknow, India, on May 23, 2019. | Rajesh Kumar Singh—AP More","Thousands of Indians ushered in the New Year by demonstrating against a citizenship law despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attempts to dampen protests that have run for nearly three weeks.

The protests have rocked India since Dec 12, when the government passed legislation easing the way for non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to gain Indian citizenship.

Combined with opposition to a proposed national register of citizens, many Indians fear the law will discriminate against minority Muslims and chip away at India’s secular constitution.

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Citizens’ Register (NRC), which were part of the election manifesto of Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist party.

Protesters had planned at least three demonstrations in New Delhi, the capital, including the area of Shaheen Bagh, where hundreds of residents have blocked a major highway for 18 days.

Irshad Alam, a 25-year-old resident of Shaheen Bagh, stood with his one-year-old in his arm and his wife by his side. He said he’d been participating in the protest every day.

“It’s freezing here,” he said, “But we are still here because we care about this movement.”

More than 200 people gathered in and around a makeshift stage in the Muslim neighbourhood chanting slogans and reciting poetry.

Resident Maqsood Alam said protesters were not afraid of a police crackdown.

“We’ve been expecting that every day. But I’ll tell you one thing,” he said. “This crowd here is not afraid of the government. They are ready to give their lives for this movement. We won’t leave here until the government takes back the law.”

Poetry recitals and speeches had been planned by organisers at a protest outside New Delhi’s Jamia Millia University, which was stormed by police this month.

“New Year’s resolution to defend the constitution,” read the schedule for another protest planned in New Delhi, now in the grip of its second coldest winter in more than a century.

Police said they had deployed additional forces in New Delhi on New Year’s Eve, with traffic curbs imposed in some parts of the capital.

“All precautionary measures are in place,” said police official Chinmoy Biswal, who oversees the southeastern part of the city that includes Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia University.

“Recently, there have been no incidents. So we hope things will remain fine,” he told Reuters.

In the southern city of Hyderabad, at least two small groups of demonstrators have been organizing flash protests, to skirt police restrictions on larger gatherings.

Typically, half a dozen demonstrators pop up in public places, such as malls and coffee shops, holding up placards and encouraging passersby to join in, a member of one of the groups, which has held 11 protests, told Reuters.

Street-side poetry recitals, stand-up comedy, and music performances are also planned in the financial capital of Mumbai and the eastern city of Kolkata.

But some protests have turned violent, particularly in the populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and at least 25 people have been killed in clashes with police since early December.

Initially caught off guard by the scale of the protests, Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has scrambled to douse public anger, with Modi declaring that there had been no discussions on the NRC, contradicting party colleagues.

The BJP is running a campaign to say that the CAA is not discriminatory and is needed to help non-Muslim minorities persecuted in the three neighbouring countries.

In 2019, the Middle East was shaken by a new round of street revolts. As the year began, Abdelaziz Bouteflika had announced a fifth run for the presidency of Algeria. Then the peaceful ""revolution of Smiles"" broke out and by April he had resigned. A small elite has for decades monopolized Algeria's oil resources and has rewarded its supporters while marginalizing everyone else. On December 12, Abdelmadjid Tebboune was elected president, amid continued massive demonstrations in major cities and a protester boycott of the election itself. The crowds are clearly unconvinced that switching out one president for another, when both are lackeys of the small Oil elite, will actually change things.

As 2019 began, Omar al-Bashir was president of the Sudan, as he had been for 30 years. A brutal dictator implicated in genocide in Darfur, he was widely considered a war criminal after an International Criminal Court ruling. By April 11, continued urban unrest and strategic rallies led by the leftist Sudanese Professionals Association and, behind the scenes, by mystical Sufi orders, had pressured the officer corps into making a coup against al-Bashir. Not satisfied with replacing one general with another, the crowds continued to pressure the military to step down in favor of a civilian government. Saudi Arabia and the UAE appear to have backed the military junta against the people, but could not forestall a compromise. In the end a form of cohabitation developed, with a new civilian government but continued military oversight and a promise of transition to pure civilian rule. Sudan lost the revenue for South Sudan's oil in 2013 when that region became an independent country, and its elite floundered in finding a new business model. Inflation was running at 75%, hurting people on fixed incomes or who depended on imports.

In ordinary times, the fall of al-Bashir should have been a huge story in the US, where at least lip service has been paid to caring about his Darfur genocide.

As 2019 began, Adel Abdulmahdi was prime minister of Iraq. Although voters had indicated in the 2018 election that they were fed up with the handful of parties that has dominated Iraq since the Bush era, Abdulmahdi was nevertheless chosen as PM. He came out of the pro-Iranian Islamic Supreme Council. Massive protests broke out at the beginning of October in Shiite cities like Nasiriya and in Baghdad's Tahrir Square. The Iraqi security forces and Shiite paramilitaries replied with deadly force, killing over 500 in October, November and December. Abdulmahdi was forced to resign. The crowds had demanded an end to corruption and to the party spoils system whereby the bigger parties in parliament were rewarded with government jobs for their supporters. They also wanted electoral reforms to block the dominance of the parties that keep winning the elections.

Just last week, the Iraqi parliament moved away from the list system, in which you vote for a party list, and toward a system were voters can vote for individual politicians. Although Iraq is pumping 3.5 million barrels a day of petroleum, the billions in receipts that go to the government have not been invested in Iraqi jobs or infrastructure.

Corruption runs so rife that the Iraqi treasury is said to be dry. All the $500 billion earned from oil sales since the Bush era seems to have just disappeared into the pockets of politicians. Crowds wanted more services and a share in the national oil wealth. Yesterday, Assad al-Eidani was nominated as prime minister. A member of the 2005-elite from the pro-Iran Islamic Supreme Council and the governor of Basra, his nomination holds out little hope of improvement of the sort the crowds demand.

As 2019 began, Saad Hariri was prime minister of Lebanon. On 17 October small street protests broke out against corruption, gridlock, lack of services, failure to collect garbage, lack of electricity, sectarianism and new taxes on the Whatsapp messaging program. By 18 December, Hariri had bowed out of consideration for another term as prime minister. The crowds are not mollified by simply switching out the prime minister for someone equally bad, and clearly intend to keep the government's feet to the fire. Trump all this fall withheld military aid from Lebanon.

All four of these popular revolts caused a sitting prime minister or president to step down. All four demanded an end to corruption and an end to government inaction on providing jobs and infrastructure.. Many wanted more and better jobs. All were nationalistic rather than fundamentalist in character. Sudan's Association of Sudanese Journalists is a leftist organization.

Algeria, Sudan, and Iraq are all oil states where the distribution of oil proceeds was closely held by the state.

All the air in American politics seems to have been sucked up by Trump and his Power Tweets, so that cable television seemed to have little energy to spare for the big developments in the world that had the potential to affect the United States.

In 2011 the American public was mesmerized by the youth street revolts that overturned governments in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen, and which plunged Bahrain into a further authoritarian miasma and kicked off an 8-year civil war in Syria. Yet they showed little interest in the similar movements this year.

Al Jazeera English: ""Asaad al-Eidani nominated as Iraq's next prime minister""","Iraqi protesters on 31 December stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad and torched its outer fence in protest against recent US airstrikes targeting Kata’ib Hezbollah Shiite militants in Iraq and Syria.

Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has condemned US airstrikes on a militant group in Iraq.

""The Iranian govt & nation & I strongly condemn the US's malice"", Khamenei said on his official Twitter account.

He continued on by saying that if anyone threatens Iran, ""we will unhesitatingly confront & strike them"".

The statement comes a day after Iraqi protesters stormed the US Embassy in the capital Baghdad in response to American airstrikes against Iraqi Shia Kata’ib Hezbollah militants.

US officials were quick to immediately claim that Iran had orchestrated the protest action, while President Trump has said that the US Embassy in Iraq was safe despite being attacked by pro-Iranian protesters and warned that Tehran would be held fully responsible for any damage caused to US facilities.

US Defence Secretary Mark Esper, for his part, said that the United States would immediately deploy about 750 servicemen to the Middle East in the wake of the events in Baghdad. Media reports said, citing sources from the Pentagon, that Washington was preparing to urgently deploy up to 4,000 troops to the region.

Iran's Foreign Ministry on the same day dismissed the ""empty"" accusations coming out of Washington about Iran allegedly orchestrating attacks on the US Embassy in Iraq.

Korea’s financial chiefs eye growth momentum in face of challenges

Gearing up for the new year, South Korea’s top financial officials steeled themselves to face persistent external challenges and to spark new momentum for growth.

As the trend toward low interest rates is expected to continue for a while, regulators vowed further efforts to curb the real estate bubble and promote market liquidity for innovative businesses.

“We need to maintain an easing monetary policy as the domestic economy faces a slow growth pace and weak inflationary pressure on the demand side,” said Bank of Korea Gov. Lee Ju-yeol in an address to employees. “Our midterm goal is to support the recovery of the economy and help market prices settle within the target range.”

The BOK forecast that the economy will expand 2.3 per cent in 2020, short of the theoretical growth potential of 2.5-2.6 per cent. The nation’s inflation rate for 2019 stood at a record low of 0.4 per cent, much lower than the BOK’s target 2 per cent.

The central bank leader also promised to pay further attention to communication so that the public can understand the delicate policy decisions needed to harmonize price stabilization and financial stabilisation.

Meanwhile, the financial authorities called on the financial sector to make strides forward and nudge the economy into a rebound.

“I am well aware that negative perspectives toward finance continue to exist (despite the policy achievements in 2019),” said Eun Sung-soo, chairman of the market regulator Financial Services Commission, in his New Year’s address. “It is therefore our key task to further develop our progress so that the people may actually feel the financial changes.”

The FSC chief called on the financial industry to play a more active role in the nation’s economy.

“The role of finance is not to sit behind and watch. It should move in step with the real economy, and each should seek to make up for the other’s blind spots,” he said.

Pointing out that market liquidity has focused excessively on real estate, instead of real industries, the chairman vowed to follow up the latest policy actions by adding momentum to regulations. On Dec. 16, the government unveiled a comprehensive set of rules to steady the housing market, including unprecedented bans on mortgage loans for expensive houses.

“This year, we shall see to it that liquidity flows from households to corporations, especially small and medium-sized ones with innovative technology and growth potential,” Eun said.

The market watchdog Financial Supervisory Service focused on consumer protection and potential risks arising from the overheated housing market and consequent household debts.

“As the nation’s risk manager, we should make all efforts to maintain the stability of the financial system in the face of various potential risks,” Yoon Suk-heun, governor of the Financial Supervisory Service, said in an address to employees.

While marginal companies and owner-operators have been weighed down by an increasing number of nonperforming loans, the real estate sector is absorbing most of the market liquidity, consequently expanding household debt risk, according to Yoon.

The FSS chief also vowed to reinforce the monitoring system for high-risk, high-income financial products for the sake of protecting consumers.

He was referring to the massive losses incurred last year due to the misselling of derivative-linked funds and securities. The FSS came up with an arbitration plan, advising sellers including Woori Bank and KEB Hana Bank to provide individual compensation of up to 80 per cent of the damages.

“The advancement of fintech and (customers’) drive for high incomes amid a low interest rate trend have increased the imbalance of information between financial companies and consumers,” Yoon said, citing the upcoming enactment of a new bill on financial consumer protection.

The Korean Federation of Banks suggested specific midterm targets.

“(Financial companies) need to enhance their global competitiveness by expanding their overseas business,” said KFB Chairman Kim Tae-young.

Overseas business currently accounts for 5 per cent of Korean banks’ total assets and 7 per cent of their net profit, according to KFB data.

Citing the so-called 10-20-30 strategy, Kim urged local banks to improve those figures to 20 per cent or more within the next 10 years and recommended that top-tier financial groups aim for 30 trillion won ($25.9 billion) in market capitalisation.

The Bank of Korea (BOK) will continue an accommodative monetary policy in 2020, as external trade uncertainties will keep holding back a short-term economic rebound here, BOK Governor Lee Ju-yeol said in a New Year’s address, Tuesday.

“Our monetary policy should be carried out in a way to support the economic recovery and stabilise prices,” he said. “We need to keep relaxing currency policies, as economic growth here in 2020 will likely fall below our expectation.”

The outlook came in response to the prolonged economic slowdown. In October, Lee also expressed his pessimistic view for the economy to achieve its 2-percent growth target during a regular National Assembly audit.

To revitalise the sagging economy, the BOK cut its key interest rate to an all-time low of 1.25 percent, October 16. The central bank also kept the rate unchanged during the final rate-setting meeting in November 2019.

Lee said the central bank would decide on the level of monetary easing in accordance with how the external risk factors unfold.

“To be specific, the prolonged trade feud between the US and China, even if they have recently made some progress, comes as a geopolitical risk for the local economy,” he said. “On the domestic front, we have to raise concerns over weakening growth engines here due to such factors as the low birthrate, aging society and social polarisation.”

On top of that, the Korean economy cannot rely on export-driven growth amid the weakening of global value chain dynamics that resulted in the economic slowdown here and abroad, according to him.

To tackle the pessimistic outlook for an economic rebound in 2020, the BOK stressed the need to enhance its capability for precise diagnosis and prediction of the economic trend.

“The BOK should be capable of accurately analysing economic conditions by utilising latest technologies, such as artificial intelligence and big data,” he said.

The governor went on to urge his staff to spare no efforts in embracing the era of digital currency.

“The BOK should not remain negligent in research and development for innovative payment technologies,” he said.

Toward the end, the chief of the central bank said it would continue to enhance research manpower on the central bank digital currency (CBDC).

With the rise of cryptocurrency, the CBDC is the talk of global financial authorities and central banks. Some countries, such as China, are in an advanced level of talks before issuing government-controlled digital currencies.

Yoon Suk-heun, governor of the Financial Supervisory Service, also reaffirmed the willingness to push for policies to eliminate potential risk factors which will get in the way of the economy recovery.

“We need to strengthen our expertise in finding out financial risks beforehand and come up with countermeasures,” he said in a New Year’s address.

Financial Services Commission Chair Eun Sung-soo also shared its 2020 goal of promoting small and medium-sized companies for the longer-term economic growth here.

“A series of relaxing monetary policies here and abroad added more liquidity to the market, but the capital was used in an unproductive manner in areas, such as real estate, which did little good to economic efficiency here,” he said. “We are going to supply small venture firms, rather than households, with the capital.”

Now, that thick blanket of haze has descended upon their neighbours, with New Zealanders waking on New Year's Day to a very apocalyptic-looking 2020.

Smoke from Australia's fires blew 1,200 miles southeast across the Tasman Sea, smothering New Zealand's South Island and turning the sun an ominous red on Wednesday. People all across the island reported the strong smell of smoke, from Christchurch to Queenstown and beyond.

""It's been happening for quite some time since the Aussie bushfires have been going,"" meteorologist Aidan Pyselman told New Zealand news website Stuff in an article published Dec. 31. ""At the moment it's definitely more noticeable, especially over the South Island.""

Latest satellite map (attached) is quite surreal for #NewZealand with thick orange smoke/dust smothering the Tasman Sea and the South Island.



You can find the latest air pollution map and several photos in the story here: https://t.co/6dliCzbsld pic.twitter.com/ESINxdZiHK — WeatherWatch.co.nz (@WeatherWatchNZ) December 31, 2019

The haze also travelled up to the North Island, covering New Zealand's capital Wellington with a gray veil. Fortunately it had thinned a bit by Thursday, and the skies are expected to clear up further as wind blows the smoke out over the Pacific Ocean.

However, New Zealanders won't be able to breathe easy just yet. Smaller plumes of smoke will continue to harass the country until Sunday, and it's likely that attacks on New Zealand's air quality will remain a threat until Australia's fires die down.

Australia's bushfires have killed 18 people, including seven in New South Wales over the past week. At least 1,400 homes have been destroyed and 11 million acres burned, with almost half a billion animals believed dead.

The unprecedented bushfires have been fuelled by hot, dry conditions across the country. Drought, strong winds, and record-breaking heat have baked Australia into perfect kindling — conditions many Australians blame on climate change.

“Just a 1C [1.8 degrees Fahrenheit] temperature rise has meant the extremes are far more extreme, and it is placing lives at risk, including firefighters,” former NSW Fire and Rescue chief Greg Mullins said in November. “Climate change has supercharged the bushfire problem.”","All the mountains in the Barrier Mountain range and through the Hollyford Valley, including the Pembroke Glacier in Milford, were stained muddy beige from the bushfires.

New Zealand's iconic white glaciers are turning shades of brown as a result of the smoke that has travelled to New Zealand from the bushfires in New South Wales and Victoria.

Social media posts from tourists and helicopter services in the last 48 hours have shown the wide impact on some of New Zealand's most popular tourist attractions.

The haze is associated with a surface trough and cold front, the bureau said.

Our Wine of the Week, Williams Selyem 2017 Russian River Valley Eastside Road Neighborhood Pinot Noir ($65), attained legendary status many years ago, as the winery became know as the center of gravity for this wily grape in what may be its best home, the cool valleys of western Sonoma County.

It is a fitting tribute, as well, to one of its founders, Burt Williams, who died early last month. As you enjoy this sultry beauty, take a moment to raise a glass to him.

The wine is light on its feet, with a silken texture, generous flavors of blackberry and Queen Anne cherry, and a brightness not unlike cool water splashing on river rocks. This wine does Burt Williams proud.

With an ultra-premium wine, it is easy to feel obligated to go fancy when pairing it at the table. And, of course, you can. Rare rack of lamb with potato puree, grilled Liberty duck breast with farro, braised mushrooms with polenta, and a luscious crab bisque all help this wine soar into its most gorgeous self.

But you needn’t go this route. The wine is just lovely with simpler, more humble fair. Enjoy it with roasted carrots and parsnips drizzled with the season’s newest olive oil, olio nuovo. Serve it alongside a great steak sandwich, with cioppino, or with a bowl of creamy polenta topped with olive oil and Gorgonzola cheese.

For today’s recipe, I’m reviving an old Christmas Eve favorite, a simple dish of broad noodles accented with more nutmeg that you might think would be good. But it resonates in such a gorgeous way with the threads of spice in the wine that both the pasta and the wine itself soar. Serve the dish as a first course, as a side dish, or as a bed for, say, seared duck breast.

Lasagna Noodles with Nutmeg & Cheese

Makes 3 to 4 servings as a first course

12-16 broad, flat noodles, see note below

— Kosher salt

4 tablespoons butter

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, preferably olio nuovo, or

2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

1½ teaspoons freshly grated nutmeg

3 ounces (¾ cup) grated Vella Dry Jack, Estero Gold, Parmigiano-Reggiano or similar cheese

¼ cup chopped walnuts, preferably red, lightly toasted

2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley

Fill a large pot half full with water, add a generous tablespoon of salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Add the noodles and cook until just done, 2 to 3 minutes for fresh, 8 to 12 for dried.

Put the butter and oil into a wide sauce pan and set it over very low heat until it just melts. Add the pepper, nutmeg and a generous teaspoon of salt and remove from the heat. Warm four soup plates or pasta bowls.

Drain the pasta and quickly tip it into the saucepan with the butter. Turn the pasta gently a few times to coat it thoroughly and divide it between the plates or bowls. Top each portion with cheese, walnuts and parsley and enjoy right away.

Note: For best results, use broad thin lasagna noodles, preferably Italian, that do not have ruffled edges. Alternately, you can use pappardelle or tagliatelle, which is about twice as wide as fettuccine.

While Australia has always been the land of extremes, climate change is now contributing to the severity of these extremes. That is bad news for horticulture as the intensive nature of our industry can lead to large losses.

To help manage risks and minimise the effects of unpredictable weather events, Growcom has developed the Horticultural Natural Disaster Toolkit. This is a great starting point for getting your business ready for storm season. It includes checklists for your emergency kit, pre and post-event activities along with tips for looking after yourself, your family and employees.

To help you prepare for an emergency the Toolkit recommends growers:

1. Assess your climate risks while considering updated climate projections and seasonal forecasts.

2. Register for weather alerts and warnings.

3. Compile a list of emergency contacts, including your local council's disaster or emergency centre.

4. Take down your neighbour's contact details and check in with them before and after a weather event.

5. Back up essential business information and records to a cloud, external hard drive or USB.

6. Discuss your emergency plan with your employees and designate someone to take the lead when you are absent. The plan should include allowances for all staff to secure their own homes.

7. Know your rights and obligations as an employer and prepare emergency kits for work and home.

8. Make sure you have access to an alternative power source (generator) and working chainsaw.

9. Have emergency fuel stocks and plenty of chainsaw oil.

10. Identify effective pruning and management strategies to protect your crops from high winds and flooding.

11. Clean up around your farm to minimise damage.

12. Ensure there is enough food stocks to last at least one week.

13. Have cash available in case of long, widespread power outages.

14. Manage inventory to ensure quick insurance claims.

15. Ensure your insurance has been recently reviewed and keep a copy of this information in your emergency kit.

141,142,Providence Lost by Paul Lay review – the rise and fall of Oliver Cromwell’s Protectorate,50 years of The Irish Post is something to be celebrated,"The only public execution of a British head of state occurred 371 years ago outside the Banqueting House in Whitehall on 30 January 1649. It was a radical, unintended act, born of failed negotiations and it entirely disregarded the people of Scotland and Ireland. The surviving details are piquant and shaming: Charles I in two shirts so as not to betray shivered fear on a cold day, a masked executioner in a wig and false beard, a collective groan from the crowd.

This used to be the moment when the curtain dropped. After an interval, or interregnum, in which Oliver Cromwell assumed power and killed all joy, the Stuarts returned for the second act, Charles II: the merry monarch. His reign was backdated to his father’s death and an Act of Oblivion drew a line under the horrid business of republic and civil war. As Paul Lay demonstrates in his immensely stimulating study of Cromwell’s Protectorate, this simply will not do. This was one of the most extraordinary, exhilarating, innovative and anxiety inducing periods in British history. There is no better time to be looking at it.

The providence of Lay’s title is the lodestone Protestant belief that God in his mystery had a hand in all things. Nothing could happen, not salvation, nor a sneeze, without divine direction. This made the hotter sort of Protestants, the Puritans, off-balance and twitchy for approval, like social media addicts, Lay observes. None was more hooked on providence than Cromwell, a yeoman farmer from Cambridgeshire (and kinsman of Henry VIII’s minister), who had risen through the ranks of the army to take effective charge of Whitehall and Westminster.

Providence is also a volcanic island in the Caribbean and it is here that the book opens, on Christmas Eve 1629, with idealistic Puritans hoping to settle a godly colony. They failed, largely because they refused to trade with Spaniards, but the vision endured, as did its backers, including key players in the Long Parliament that went to war with the king. At the battles of Naseby, Marston Moor and the “crowing mercy” of Worcester, God blew and the royalists were scattered. Providence justified the abolition of the monarchy and the House of Lords, just as it explained Cromwell’s clean sheet of victories. After his seemingly miraculous defeat of the Scots at Dunbar in 1650, he was seen laughing excessively “as if he had been drunk; his eyes sparkled with spirits”.

Others thought he was high on hubris. In December 1653, having forcibly dissolved two parliaments, Cromwell accepted the title of Lord Protector, which was written into a constitution known as the Instrument of Government. It was resisted by the first protectorate parliament and so, in a constitutional contortion that might make even today’s politicians blush, Cromwell dissolved parliament by counting its minimum period in lunar months, rather than the conventional, longer, calendar months. “I speak for God and not for men,” he told MPs. He was beginning to sound a lot like Charles I.

Cromwell’s fundamental goal was liberty of conscience, but his challenge was to keep his army standing, deliver strong and stable government (“healing and settling”) and shape the people into a nation worthy of Christ’s imminent return. In that great gross line, he described the English as “under circumcision, but raw”. Above all, he strained to hear God’s voice once the guns had fallen silent.

The answer, he decided, was global. He would take God’s fight back to the Caribbean, seize the island of Hispaniola, avenge the loss of Providence and return with enough bullion to pay the army. The expedition commander was so buoyed by the venture that it doubled as his honeymoon. He returned to Portsmouth “almost a skeleton” and was dispatched to the Tower of London. The “Western Design” was an abject failure. The subsequent conquest of Jamaica was a face-saving afterthought and, it would turn out, the inversion of liberty.

In that crucial year, 1655, Cromwell also suppressed an ineffectual royalist rebellion. Spurred by John Lambert, the hero of Dunbar, he surmised that God would be placated by a clampdown on security and sin. England was divided into military districts. Former royalists had to register their movements and pay for the privilege in the form of a decimation tax. Vagrants were apprehended. Meetings at racecourses and bear-baiting rings, where conspiracies might fester, were dispersed. War was waged on fornication, drunkenness and gambling: “wars unwinnable”, Lay notes. In Altham, Lancashire, 200 unlicensed alehouses were closed within three months of the arrival of Major-General Worsley, a fundamentalist who drove himself to death in his maniacal pursuit of vice. The major generals lacked the resources to effect a moral reformation and were soon rejected by the electorate. It was, nevertheless, a dystopian time and not forgotten: “No man in uniform has ruled Britain since Cromwell,” Lay points out.

Providence Lost is a learned, lucid, wry and compelling narrative of the 1650s as well as a sensitive portrayal of a man unravelled by providence. Lay’s Cromwell is dithering and ambiguous, too slippery to pin down, but almost likable, almost true. He welcomed Jews back to England, even if he aimed to convert them to Christianity (Sigmund Freud named his son Oliver). He regretted, on a personal and procedural level, the Commons’ retrospective judgment of James Nayler, a priapic, lank haired Quaker with messianic pretensions, who was branded for blasphemy and whipped until his back was a sheet of raw flesh. (One MP even mooted the obscure Roman punishment of stitching him into a sack with a dog, a cock, a viper and an ape, and tossing him into the river.)

As Cromwell settled into his reign – an accurate enough word – he displayed shades of hypocrisy. “Lascivious” songs and stage plays were forbidden, but the elite could enjoy dancing and the first English opera. Cromwell dipped into Charles I’s art collection and had a room at Hampton Court draped in sinful tapestries. And yet: when, in the wake of a royalist-leveller gunpowder plot in 1657, the issue of the succession led to parliament offering Cromwell the crown, he turned it down: “I would not seek to set up that which providence hath destroyed.”

On Cromwell’s death in 1658, the Protectorate passed to his son Richard, who had that rare gift in politics of realising when he was not up to the job. He did not resist when army radicals ousted him in May 1659. The following year, having lost any semblance of order or legitimacy, they too were gone. The Protectorate was too out of touch, too reliant on the sword and far too expensive to be missed. Its failure ensured that whichever randy prince might come along, monarchy would endure.

Two contemporary works capture the contrasting tempers of the time. The Anglican Izaak Walton’s The Compleat Angler is a fishing manual that rejoices in the beauty and bounty of the land. It reflects still waters and a contented patience beyond the ken of Puritanism. Lay doesn’t discuss John Milton’s Paradise Lost, but the title and its themes of tyranny and failed revolution shadow every page of his book. Milton gave his life to the Puritan cause and was crushed by its betrayal, but even when he went blind, he did not lose sight of liberty, or God. Paradise Lost closes with Adam and Eve wiping their tears and venturing out of Eden with “providence their guide”. It is an epic, eloquent scream into the cataclysm and a testament to the intellectual ferment of the republic, but it is the quiet little fishing book that has been reprinted more often.

The Daily Mirror, The Observer, and The Irish Post.

The Mirror in those days had the likes of Paul Foot and John Pilger writing for it.

This was the days before every tabloid became purely an extension of the entertainment industry. The Observer, which I still get to this day, brought in-depth international news coverage to our inner city streets.

And The Irish Post was our newspaper talking about us.

Advertisement

I think The Irish Post must have been fundamental in many a second and third generation sense of identity because here was a newspaper talking about that very life.

Sitting in a house in England, belonging to an Irish family, reading The Irish Post, was as natural a part of our life as Coronation Street on the television and the Sacred Heart on the wall.

In those days the Post was campaigning on behalf of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six.

In those days the Frank Dolan column was the page I first looked for and it was full of such depth and such insight into Irish life in Britain, and in Ireland, that it gave me the fundamental knowledge I’ve built my own flimsy understandings on.

In those days the pages of The Irish Post detailed in pictures and in words the vibrant social life of the Irish in Britain.

All over Britain the Irish living a life of such vitality and exuberance that, for those of us that experienced it, lives still in our memories.

There it all was in the pages of a newspaper. Proof of it.

Advertisement

I grew up in it and I lived it. But when I first brought English people to it, people I’d met whilst away studying, I saw it through their eyes and saw in their eyes that this brilliant world was unknown to them.

This Irish life in Britain was invisible to the British. They’d never seen anything like it.

It was so full of life it was bursting at the seams. I’d almost think now, at this distance, that I’d imagined it. Those clubs and those pubs, those afternoons and those nights.

But it was all recorded there in the pages of a newspaper. In the pages of The Irish Post.

The Irish Post, so full of living that it actually died and came back to life.

My father bought The Irish Post religiously and not just because I was in it.

It was more that for him and my mother, back here in Ireland now, that the paper was an enduring connection with that intrinsic part of their life.

Advertisement

That life where they were Irish in Britain. In the confident decades we’ve had recently, and watching my own children grow up now secure and unapologetic in their Irishness, it is difficult to explain how being Irish used to be.

Ireland was not in any way a ‘cool’ country and being Irish was not anything anyone aspired to.

The Irish Post flew the flag in days and in places where being Irish was difficult.

It came out of a community that wasn’t full of the hipster swagger that constitutes a lot of today’s Irishness.

It came from a people who had no choice but to be emigrants, who had, by and large, left school early because that was the only option, and who experienced the cold winds of hostility and prejudice.

The Irish Post helped people like my parents to keep their heads up when being Irish was something you might be wiser to be silent about.

I hope younger and future generations remember that. They should.

A newspaper that comes out of a community and survives for fifty years is something to be celebrated.

In the New Year we can, at least, be proud and positive about that.

With English nationalists now in charge in Britain it might be a comfort greatly needed to have this paper around.

How newspapers themselves survive in the digital world we are busy building, with all of the recklessness of those who think the world has just been invented, I don’t know.

But here The Irish Post still is. I know it’s January but that’s worth raising a glass for, isn’t it?

142,143,"Letter: Democrats care about votes, not people",A lot on its way in coming year,"I was recently trolled in an online debate. I was raving about President Trump’s booming economy and the fact that there’s record employment numbers, wage gains for woman, people of color and blue-collar workers. The troll invoked their disgusting identity politics and reminded me that this was the Democrats’ base. My response was: “Fantastic, perhaps they will finally realize that Republicans want them to succeed, Democrats only want their vote.” To prove this point, just 6 months ago Democrats and their allies in the fake news media were hoping for a pre-election recession, a clear indicator that they’re putting party before country.

Putting party over country is exactly what New Hampshire’s all-Democratic congressional delegation is doing. These partisans spent the whole year trying to reverse the will of the people with a Marxist-style un-American impeachment, totally absent of any sense of fairness. These partisans spent little to no time representing the people of New Hampshire. In November, we the people of New Hampshire have the chance to cast our own impeachment vote and remove Jeanne Shaheen, Annie Kuster and Chris Pappas from office and replace them with people who’ll actually represent the people of New Hampshire and respect the will of the people.

With the scary clown car show crossing New Hampshire, we are getting a good look at how extreme their party is. In fact, the frontrunner, who thinks he is above the law, is so error prone that his campaign restricts his campaign appearances. No-show Joe often doesn’t even know what state he’s campaigning in.

VAN MOSHER

Bow","It’ll begin very soon, with state caucuses and primaries starting in Iowa and New Hampshire, and impeachment roaring out of the nation’s capital, all in January.

The biggest monkey wrench to be thrown into the crossover between the 2019 posturing and the 2020 reality checking, in my opinion, wasn’t the articles of impeachment — we’ve known that was coming for months now, and still don’t know how it will affect the election. Instead, I think it came as a crack in President Trump’s armor, in the form of an editorial calling for Trump’s removal from office.

“If we don’t reverse course now,” the evangelical magazine Christianity Today opined, “will anyone take anything we say about justice and righteousness with any seriousness for decades to come? Can we say with a straight face that abortion is a great evil that cannot be tolerated and, with the same straight face, say that the bent and broken character of our nation’s leader doesn’t really matter in the end?”

In other words, if opponents of abortion rights want to have any “moral authority” whatsoever, they can’t be standing with an immoral president — a point that will haunt a lot of Trump-supporting Christians all year long.

And speaking of immoral behavior, here’s an incredible question a lot of people are asking these days: If Trump loses re-election in November, will he step down? And if he refused to give up the presidency, would the Senate oppose the coup attempt? I want so badly to say that’s an absurd question, but given Trump’s and the Republican Party’s behavior these days, you’ve got to wonder.

Then there’s the Democratic Party contest for who gets to take on Trump. I have no idea who’s going to win the nomination, but this much is pretty clear: Whoever gets the party nod will capture at least half the popular vote, because that’s roughly the number of “Never Trump” Americans (both Democrats and Republicans) who will — to corrupt an old Southern saying — vote for a yellow dog over Donald Trump.

143,144,‘Jackbox Party Pack 6:’ A Solid Option For New Year’s Eve Gaming,"One dies in Jan 1 auto crash on, Ore Road","The games included in 'Jackbox Party Pack 6.' Jackbox Games

It’s New Year’s Eve, you’re sitting around with friends waiting for the ball to drop, and you’d rather not watch tired musical acts vamping on TV. Jackbox Games releases their party packs for just such an occasion, and Jackbox Party Pack 6 is the latest installment.

All Jackbox games operate the same way: You fire up the game on your console, smart TV or about a million other platforms, and all your guests pull out their phones, tablets, laptops, etc. The games’ prompts are on the TV; the guests’ answers and drawings and selections are on their devices.

It’s a great system, because half the fun of Jackbox games are seeing things that are kept hidden from you until they’re displayed. While Jackbox Party Pack 6 (ranging in price from $21-$30 depending on platform) isn’t the best Jackbox Games offering — it’s missing some notable, wonderful games from previous packages, including Drawful and Fibbage — it’s a solid outing in the series if you already own the previous titles.

If you haven’t ever played Jackbox games, try one of the earlier collections first (numbers one through three are particularly strong.)

Party Pack 6 includes:

Trivia Murder Party 2: One of the best in the bunch, this sequel turns you into woven dolls and asks you trivia questions, pitting you against your friends in a race to escape a haunted hotel in time.

Dictionarium: The favorite among my family this holiday, this game asks you to set meanings for fake words, words for meanings and antonyms, then vote on the frequently-hilarious results.

Push The Button: A twist on the “who’s the murderer” genre, this game makes some of the people in your party aliens, then presents slightly different questions to aliens and non-aliens. The whole group votes on who’s answering just a little oddly, and once people think they know the answer, they can “Push the Button” to put two people in an airlock and jettison them into space. Manipulating this game as an alien is pretty darned fun.

Joke Boat: One of the weaker entries, this game asks you to come up with snappy jokes about supplied topics, which is a core part of all Jackbox games. For some reason, the prompts here don’t work as well as they do in other titles from earlier collections, such as Quiplash.

Role Models: This game has the group pick out who amongst them is best suited for different characters/roles — the characters in Alice in Wonderland, say, or the seasons of the year — and then assigns them personality types as a result.

Our group of five didn’t get into this much, and while my downvote may be affected by my being declared a “domineering angry dreamer” at the end — you can guess who got to be the Red Queen! — we played it just once and moved on.","One dies in Jan 1 auto crash on, Ore Road

Then, they constructed their second building for Saraswathi Vilas Government Aided Primary School in Kovilpathu, at the cost Rs 11.7 lakh and opened it on June 23. The third school was completed at a cost of Rs 8 lakh near Vedaranyam.

'Our volunteers were into the field for more than 15 days and came up with a reasonable suggestion to rebuild 3 of primary aided schools in #Nagapattinam Dist', reads the Facebook post.





“We collected donations from employees in PSU and private companies. Our volunteers also contributed to the cause. This was challenging because the village was remote and not easily accessible” said R Vinoth Kumar, an IT-engineer and the coordinator of Direction for Volunteers told The New Indian Express



The building for Government-aided primary school in Vandal is the final one of their series of the rebuilding of school buildings damaged by Gaja, which cost Rs 27.4 lakh .

Kudos to all the people who contributed time, money and effort to make this happen; it shows how resilient human beings can be.","Missing kayaker pulled from St. Joseph River in Niles has died

NILES, Mich. -- The man who was pulled from the St. Joseph River in Niles around noon on Wednesday has died, according to law enforcement.

Around 8:30 a.m., four men launched a kayak near the dam at a legal launch site, according to Niles Fire Chief Larry Lamb.

“We had four adult males enter that actually entered the water just up there on the other side of the dam. Two actually had a lot of kayaking experience and the other two didn’t have any,"" Lamb said.

At some point all four men entered the water.

One paddled to safety and called for help.

A second male was out of the water by the time first responders arrived.

The third was rescued from the water by first responders.

All three were in stable condition.

Emergency crews spent the morning searching for the fourth kayaker.

“The last known location for the fourth victim was up here near the dam area. So we investigated, there’s a cable system up there and a large log and we were able to shake the log free and recover the fourth victim,” Lamb said.

The fourth man was found and transported to the hospital. He was pronounced deceased a short time after being taken to the hospital, according to law enforcement.

“We would like to make sure that people know that they shouldn’t be going into the river unless they really know what they’re doing, especially above a dam,” Lamb said.

146,147,Chandigarh: Murder convict out on bail ‘kills’ woman friend in hotel room,JNU to continue with registration boycott,"Police at the scene of crime at Hotel Sky in Industrial Area Phase-I, Chandigarh, Wednesday. (Express photo: Jaipal Singh) Police at the scene of crime at Hotel Sky in Industrial Area Phase-I, Chandigarh, Wednesday. (Express photo: Jaipal Singh)

A 30-YEAR-OLD convict currently out on bail in a murder case allegedly killed his woman friend in a room at Hotel Sky situated in Phase-1, Industrial Area. He is on the run. The accused was identified as Maninder Singh, a resident of Sector 30, and the victim as Sarabjeet Kaur, 28, a resident of Kakra village in Sangrur.

Police said Sarabjeet was a qualified nurse. She had been selected for All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Bathinda. She was expected to join a training course at PGIMER this week. Maninder and Sarabjeet had been in a relationship for around two years.

The accused was convicted in 2014 for killing his woman friend in Karnal in 2010. In 2016, he was granted bail by the Punjab and Haryana High Court as his appeal against the conviction was accepted. The CCTV camera recording of the hotel shows the accused left the hotel after committing the crime on December 30. The murder came to light on Wednesday afternoon. The hotel staff did not get any response when they knocked at the door. As one of the staff members opened the door with the master key, the woman was found dead on the bed. There was a sharp injury mark on her neck. The body was covered with a quilt.

Sources said Maninder and Sarabjeet had been in a relationship for the last two years and had visited the hotel together earlier as well. A police officer said, “Families of both accused and victim were aware of their relationship. Maninder wanted to marry Sarabjeet. But her elder brother declined, citing caste differences. It appears kin of the victim also came to know about criminal background of Maninder. Sarabjeet had once also rejected his proposal.”

Maninder had booked the hotel room online through Makemytrip website for December 30. Ankit Sharma, front office manager at the hotel, said, “The two entered the hotel late in evening on December 30. Maninder had booked the room for two days. They submitted their identity proofs. This afternoon they were supposed to check out. I knocked at the room but did not receive any response. The door was opened with a master key. Room boy Sumit noticed the body and raised the alarm. I informed the police about the body.”

Senior police officers, including SSP Nilambri Vijay Jagdale, ASP Neha Yadav and Sector 31 SHO Rajdeep Singh, rushed to the spot.

A police officer said, “CCTV recording of hotel shows Maninder had left the hotel around 11.56 pm on December 30. Nobody was sitting at the reception when he left the hotel. Till this afternoon, hotel staff members were under the impression that Maninder is also inside the room. Since December 30, hotel staff members had not received any order from the room.” A case of murder was registered at the Sector 31 police station.

‘Accused is shy and religious’

Neighbours of accused Maninder Singh, known as Raja, in Sector 30 were aware of his involvement in the earlier murder case in Karnal. They maintained he came out from a Haryana jail around four years ago. The neighbours said Maninder is a shy person. He is baptised and also does shabad-kirtan in local gurdwaras. His father is a carpenter. His mother is a housewife.

Sources said the woman murdered in 2010 by Maninder was also known to him and he murdered her because later she wanted to marry someone else. A woman neighbour said, “Raja committed the crime in 2010 and returned three years ago. He is the only son of his parents. His two sisters are married and settled in Mohali. He had been working with a private firm in Industrial Area and left the job three months back.

He is a religious person.” The house of the accused was locked. Sources said his parents were being questioned.

Registration for the winter semester has been opened from January 1 to 5. Students have said they will “lock down” offices of the Mess Manager and Cashier.

The boycott has been called due to two circulars from the administration — one that said hiked room rent would be levied from students during registration, while remaining mum on service and utility charges, and the other that said students who haven’t completed their “academic requirements” would be given provisional registration if they give assignments by January 20.

147,148,"Here are some far-right reactionaries the term ‘OK, Boomer’ was perfectly designed for",WATCH: Rudy Giuliani goes instantly off the rails at Mar-A-Lago over impeachment question,"During the 1960s, some members of the Baby Boomer Generation were fond of saying, “Never trust anyone over 30.” And now, ironically, Boomers — or at least some Boomers — have become targets of the dismissive expression, “OK, Boomer,” which is used primarily by Millennials and members of Generation Z. The expression certainly isn’t aimed at everyone over 60; Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is 78, and the 70-year-old Sen. Elizabeth Warren aren’t the typical targets of “OK, Boomer” — in fact, Sanders enjoys more support among Millennials and members of Gen-Z than he among people his own age. But it is typically used out of frustration when a far-right Boomer says something that is clueless, reactionary and painfully out-of-touch; for example, a Millennial or Gen-Z member might offer a mountain of evidence on medical bankruptcies to show how broken the United States’ health care system is — and when the Boomer, indoctrinated by Fox News and AM talk radio, still insists that the U.S. has the best health insurance system in the world, the Millennial or Gen-Z member might respond, “OK, Boomer.”

Here are some far-right reactionaries who the expression “OK, Boomer” was tailor-made for.

1. Rush Limbaugh

Radio host Rush Limbaugh, now 68, has been wrong time and time again — and no amount of evidence will change his mind about the War on Drugs (which he has wholeheartedly supported), the Iraq War (a foreign policy disaster he championed) or the health care crisis in the U.S. Even when Limbaugh had an addiction to OxyContin in 2003, he wouldn’t acknowledge that the War on Drugs was a failure. And when he was admitted to the hospital in 2010 after suffering chest pains, Limbaugh asserted, “I don’t think there’s one thing wrong with the United States health system.” Sure, millionaires have easy access to top-notch health care; others suffer medical bankruptcy or avoid going to the doctor when they get sick because they can’t afford it.

2. Ted Nugent

During his youth, Ted Nugent went to great lengths to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. But these days, the hard rock singer/guitarist and far-right activist, now 71, views himself as hell-belt for the U.S. military and insists that liberals and progressives could never be as patriotic and pro-military as he is. Democrats have a long history of being hawkish militarily, from World War I and World War II to the Korean War; regardless, Nugent clings to the notion that only far-right Republicans love the military.

3. President Donald Trump

President Donald Trump is full of contradictions. He has hardly lived the life of a Christian fundamentalist, yet he panders to the Christian Right. Trump claims to be a fiscal conservative, yet the U.S. has a huge federal deficit under his watch. Trump claims to sympathize with the millions of Americans who lack health insurance or are seriously underinsured, but he has tried to roll back the modest gains of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, a.k.a. Obamacare. And when he is contradicting himself on Twitter or at a MAGA rally, there are no doubt plenty of Millennials and Gen-Z members thinking, “OK, Boomer.”

4. Bill O’Reilly

Inundated with sexual harassment allegations, Bill O’Reilly left Fox News in 2017. But that hasn’t prevented O’Reilly, now 70, from ranting about the Culture War and insisting that he is a staunch social conservative. It was O’Reilly who, more than anyone, pushed the silly conspiracy theory that there is a “War on Christmas” being carried out by liberals and progressives. One can point out to O’Reilly that even in the most Democratic U.S. cities, one is surrounded by Christmas songs, Christmas lights and Christmas decorations — yet he still insists that the “War on Christmas” is alive and well, no doubt inspiring some of his younger critics to roll their eyes in frustration and say, “OK, Boomer.”","Rudy Giuliani wants to turn President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial into a prosecution case against Joe Biden.

149,150,Why merit alone should triumph in the armed forces,"We stay away from politics, says CDS Gen Bipin Rawat","In the final analysis, when all is said and done, merit alone triumphs. Ultimately it was PM Modi who was responsible for Balakot, so the people of India reposed their faith in him once again.

I am not going into the merits or the demerits of having a chief of defence staff (CDS) position. The PM in his eternal wisdom has decided that there will be a CDS. So be it.

Let’s return to the question of merit. Who in the defence forces has been responsible for Balakot, India’s greatest military triumph since 1971. I am ignoring Kargil here because I don’t really regard it as a victory, no matter the spin given to it. In Kargil, intruders entered our house, and we utilized military and diplomatic means to push them out. What kind of victory was that?

In Balakot, the air force coordinated with the navy to give the enemy a stunning riposte. The navy blockaded Karachi port making the enemy believe that an attack was imminent from there, while the air force utilized the feint to knock out Balakot. There was great coordination between the air force and the navy. The army seemed to have been an alert bystander.

Military credit for Balakot should, therefore, go to Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa as well as Admiral Sunil Lamba, who headed the air force and navy respectively at the time of Balakot. Both are recently retired officers now but that should not have stopped any of them from being made the CDS, because their ages are well below the retirement age of the CDS, which is 65.

In such a high-profile role as the CDS, the military will respect only someone with outstanding merit, someone who has shown exemplary success in his military career. The three five-star officers, Cariappa, Manekshaw, and Arjan Singh would have all made outstanding CDSs. Some might even consider Sundarji, dubbed the thinking general, as apt for the role, but Sundarji could have fallen into Bonapartism.

Certainly, he took the surprise to the Pakistanis (and some say even to his own PM Rajiv Gandhi) with his aggressive tactics in Operation Brasstacks, but it was his teaming up with the then-minister of state for defence, Arun Singh, to coerce Gandhi to send the Indian Peace Keeping Force to Sri Lanka that stained his legacy.

General Bipin Rawat has become the first CDS of the country. My heartiest congratulations to him. In his capacity of the army chief, General Rawat had spoken out against the recent countrywide protests, which statement drew sharp ripostes from politicians, especially P. Chidambaram.

When the government made General Rawat the army chief, it superseded two generals more senior than him. More recently, it made Admiral Karambir Singh the navy chief by superseding a naval officer six months senior than him. In both instances, the government stated that merit, and not just seniority, should decide who becomes a service chief, effectively bucking the trend of governments of the recent past who tended to stick to the seniority principle.

General Rawat has had a full three-year term as army chief. He has managed the counter-insurgency in Kashmir relatively well, but is there a signal military success that can be attributed to him? He has been voluble in the media, but is that necessarily a good thing?

He is perceived as close to the national security adviser (NSA), Ajit Doval. That actually is a good thing now that he has become CDS. But the post of NSA itself is new, starting only with the Vajpayee regime. The NSA heads the national security council, of whose part all three services chiefs are, so in effect, there is already an overall boss of the military, albeit a civilian. Now with the CDS, another layer is being added.

The CDS will have to earn the respect of the entire military. The military only respects those who have succeeded in battle, not those who interfere in civilian affairs, even if delicately. The recent military officers who have seen signal success are the aforementioned Dhanoa and Lamba. The government should have brought one of them from the cold and made him the CDS.

The army is by far the biggest defence service and has therefore dominated the overall military. Having a Dhanoa from the air force or a Lamba from the navy as CDS would have redressed the balance in favour of the smaller services.","Newly-appointed Chief of the Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, on Wednesday said the armed forces stay away from politics and work as per the directives of the government of the day, remarks that come amid allegations that the forces were being politicised.





The former Army Chief took charge as the first Chief of Defence Staff today and said his task is to create synergy between different wings of the armed forces.





""We keep ourselves away from politics. We act according to the directives of the government of the day,"" he said.

General Bipin Rawat was named as India's first Chief of Defence Staff a day before he was to retire from services after completing a full three-year term as the Chief of Army Staff.





Days before the government announced its decision to appoint him as the CDS, General Rawat was surrounded in controversy, owing to his comment on the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. He had criticised the people leading violent protests against the new legislation.





The Cabinet Committee on Security had, in a landmark decision last week, approved the creation of the CDS who will act as the principal military adviser to the defence minister on all matters relating to tri-services.





The recommendation for the CDS had first been made after the Kargil War.

150,151,Israel's justice minister will take care of it - Haaretz Editorial - Israel News,Not justiciable,"Justice Minister Amir Ohana’s choice of Orly Ginsberg Ben-Ari as acting state prosecutor, defying Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit, is but the latest attempt by the caretaker government headed by the indicted Benjamin Netanyahu to undermine the rule of law. It also dovetails with Netanyahu’s battle cries against the State Prosecutor’s Office after the release of the attorney general’s decision to try him for bribery, fraud and breach of trust.

According to Mendelblit, the choice of Ginsberg Ben-Ari “doesn’t meet the necessary requirements for the position of acting state prosecutor” and that it “exceeds, in an extreme way, the scope of what is reasonable.”

Thus, he said, “there is a legal impediment to its approval.” According to Civil Service Commissioner Daniel Hershkowitz, the choice “is liable to erode the proper functioning of the state prosecutor.”

Ohana is neither interested in these arguments of substance nor in the facts that he is justice minister in a caretaker government, and that the country is in the midst of a third election cycle due to the deadlock stemming from Netanyahu’s legal predicament. Ohana was well aware of Mendelblit’s warnings when he announced his candidates for the position. Mendelblit made it clear that the justice minister must consult with him before the appointment, and not to deviate from his recommendation unless he presents compelling arguments. He even named the deputy state prosecutor for criminal affairs, Shlomo Lemberger, as his preference.

To make matters worse, the appointment was made at a particularly sensitive moment. Now the cases against the prime minister will be laid on the table of the state prosecutor, which will require “dealing with various legal aspects connected to the decision to try the prime minister,” as Mendelblit stressed in his opinion on Tuesday. “These are sensitive issues that require an even greater obligation to ensure the independence of the person holding the position, and above all the public appearance of independence.”

None of this prevented Ohana from defying Mendelblit and the Israeli Judicial Authority. True to the spirit of his commander, who spreads tales of a legal putsch and seeks “to investigate the investigators,” Ohana is abusing his temporary political power in an attempt to weaken the institution of the state prosecutor. Instead of respecting the circumstances and reducing his presence in the appointment process, Ohana seeks to squeeze everything he can get out of his temporary position.

Mendelblit pledged in closed-door meetings in the Justice Ministry that he would refuse to defend the appointment of a person unqualified for the job. “I won’t be a part of it,” he told his colleagues. The issue of the appointment will probably end up in the High Court of Justice, and the court is not expected to approve it. Thus, the public has received another reminder of the urgent need to replace Netanyahu’s corrupt and messianic regime.

The above article is Haaretz’s lead editorial, as published in the Hebrew and English newspapers in Israel.","The decision by the High Court of Justice to hear a petition to rule out the possibility of Benjamin Netanyahu competing for the post of prime minister in the upcoming elections, has exacerbated the already existing tension between the political and judicial systems, to the point of posing a real threat to the stability of Israel’s democracy.The High Court cannot refrain from dealing with any case that comes before it out of fear for its status. Should such a fear prevail and paralyze the rule of law, the judicial system will have lost its independence. If judges can be intimidated once, they can be intimidated in the future as well – thus destroying the most outstanding public service in Israel. If the High Court operates on the basis of profit-and-loss considerations, at the end of the day all of us will be the losers.But does it follow from this that the High Court should issue a ruling on whether Netanyahu, who is facing criminal charges, is a legitimate candidate to form the next government if he wins the election? I think not.Even those who believe, as a matter of principle, that any and all issues are subject to a judicial decision – “everything is justiciable” – understand that it is not a good idea to translate every issue into legal language and assign its resolution to judges. Indeed, jurists in Israel and abroad debate the appropriate policy for involving the courts and on delineating the boundaries of their engagement: what is justiciable and what is not.When the country is facing an election, and a sufficiently large number of its citizens are likely to vote for a man who is facing criminal charges, and will do so fully aware of the relevant details, the courts must take a step back and refrain from intervening in the public’s decision. The election of a prime minister is at the core of the political arena, and the courts must respect this.It is true that in principle there is nothing barring Israeli law from intervening in this matter (and it would even be desirable), and the Knesset could have legislated that a person facing criminal charges may not run for the office of prime minister or be called on to form a government. However, as we know, the law currently says nothing on this matter. It seems that the legislature has chosen to keep this issue outside the courtroom.THE JUDICIAL system sees itself, and rightly so, as one of the guardians of Israeli democracy. Together with law-enforcement agencies, it shares the responsibility, among other things, to stamp out corruption in general and governmental corruption in particular. The system has not been daunted that the police, the state prosecutor and the attorney-general in an orderly and well thought-out process, decided to file an indictment against the prime minister. But with that their role comes to an end, until the charges have been heard by the court.Alongside this clear statement, there is also a need for a clear statement regarding the responsibility of the prime minister and his supporters for the deterioration of the public’s attitude toward the rule of law. We are witnessing a prime minister who is deliberately stirring up public delegitimization of bringing his case to the courts. This maneuver, which initially targeted the police and subsequently the state prosecutor, and now has the attorney-general in its line of fire, will be directed in the future – let there be no doubt about this – at the courts as well.Time after time, the prime minister and his minions, of whom the most prominent – how ironic – is the minister of justice, confront the legal system and stir up emotions. Somewhat outrageous statements jabs (“a prosecution inside the prosecution,” “a governmental coup”) and vitriolic actions (the dismissal of the director general of the Justice Ministry; the attempt to appoint an acting state prosecutor in defiance of the desire of her superior, the attorney-general), driven by inappropriate motives, have become the norm in recent months.In the history of the State of Israel, this attack will be remembered as the low point of Netanyahu’s years in power. Historians will wonder how one of the country’s most important leaders, who did so much to protect it against external enemies, could possibly have acted at the very same time and with consistent determination, moved by his own private interests, to weaken it from within.Netanyahu and those who do his bidding are tainting themselves by shaking the very foundations of democracy, one of whose main elements is the rule of law.Israel needs a time out, a quiet time, a cease-fire – in the ongoing battle between the judicial system and the political system.

151,152,We're open: Todd Phillips on 'Joker' sequel,Joaquin Phoenix's Joker had a shocking alternative ending,"Filmmaker Todd Phillips says he is game to further explore the iconic DC villain Joker if an ideal opportunity comes his way.

Phillips recently directed ""Joker"", featuring Joaquin Phoenix as the Clown Prince of Crime. The film received overwhelming reviews from the critics and was a box office success, grossed over USD 1 billion worldwide.

Ever since, the director has been facing questions regarding a potential sequel to the film.

Phillips said at Deadline's The Contenders New York award-season event he is ""open"" to reunite with Phoenix but nothing is final as of yet.

""When a movie does USD 1 billion and costs USD 60 million to make, of course, it comes up. But Joaquin and I haven't really decided on it. We're open.

""I mean, I'd love to work with him on anything, quite frankly,"" the filmmaker said.

Even if the project is a sequel to ""Joker"", Phillips said he will only direct if he believes the new film will be able to resonate with the audiences like the original.

""So who knows? But it would have to have a real thematic resonance the way this one did, ultimately being about childhood trauma and the lack of love, and the loss of empathy,"" the director said.

""All those things are really what made this movie work for us, so we'd have to have something that had an equal thematic resonance,"" he added.

The blockbuster comic-book film ""Joker"" has a terrifying ending, but there was an even more shocking and horrifying alternative ending to Todd Phillips movie, starring Joaquin Phoenix in the starring role.

In a Fatman Beyond podcast recently, filmmaker Kevin Smith claimed that there was one alternative ending planned for the now blockbuster movie, reports independent.co.uk.

In the climax of the official version, Arthur Fleck aka Joker (Phoenix) follows Thomas and Martha Wayne and kills them, leaving young Bruce Wayne (who then goes to become Batman). In the alternate ending, Joker kills Bruce as well.

""Originally, the ending in the hospital was different. He's in the hospital and he laughs, chuckles, and he says, ‘I was just thinkin' of something funny'. What was supposed to happen was you flashed back to the death of Thomas and Martha Wayne, and it was him (Joker) killing Thomas and Martha Wayne and the boy was screaming and crying and he turned to walk away and he turned back, shrugged, and shot the kid. Credits,"" he said.

Smith said he was told the ending by someone ""who works in the business"" and called it ""reliable information"". He said: ""It was too f***ing good not to share and I f***ing hope it's true"".

The Warner Bros. project has become the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time, and has crossed the $ 1 billion mark at the worldwide box office. In fact, the impact is deep as it has sparked conversation around mental health. A follow-up to film is also in the works.

Phoenix is being considered as a contender of Best Actor Oscar this year.

The mood of the market turned quickly at the end of last year. Photo / Getty Images

The 2010s were a turbulent, transformative and testing time for the global economy but there was not a recession.

That is extremely rare. In fact, it is the first decade in the post-world war II era without a downturn in the UK and US.

A year ago many economists thought the global economy would be crawling over the line into the 2020s and would suffer a recession soon after.

• A recession will come, but how bad will it be?

• Jared Bernstein: Just how likely is a recession?

• Experts warn the next recession will be 'worse than the Great Depression' and predict it will hit US within two years

The trade war had escalated at a frightening pace, Brexit was in deadlock, global factories were heading into a deep industrial recession and central banks appeared to be oblivious to the threat of a downturn. The market's most-trusted recession signal - the US Treasury yield curve - then flashed red, predicting one within 24 months.

But the mood on markets has turned on a pinhead.

An ageing, and in some parts of the world record-long, economic cycle appears to have been given a shot in the arm. City forecasters have pencilled a slight acceleration in global growth from 2019's post-financial crisis low of 3pc to 3.1pc this year and 3.2pc in 2021. What changed?

The headwinds that threatened to tip the world into the next economic crisis have waned substantially. The US and China have reached an agreement for a ""phase one"" trade deal, potentially putting a pause on the protectionist wave sweeping the globe.

Boris Johnson's decisive victory in the election will not only get his Brexit deal over the line but gives him more wriggle room in the next stage of negotiations.

And crucially central banks have moved from tightening financial conditions to cutting interest rates and ploughing more money into markets.

The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, cut borrowing costs three times this year and moved from reversing quantitative easing - its bond-buying programme - to expanding its balance sheet again. The European Central Bank has also extended its experimental policies to revive growth, cutting rates deeper into negative territory and restarting its QE programme after an ill-conceived attempt to end it a year ago.

While many economists fret central banks will now not have the firepower to fight a recession if one does strike, the latest burst of stimulus has catapulted stock markets to new record highs. Global stocks have followed their worst year since the financial crisis in 2018 with their best, gaining 25 per cent last year.

But with growth still languishing at post-crisis lows, are investors sleepwalking into the next recession?

Most Wall Street analysts have predicted that the US-China breakthrough and the Fed's policy U-turn will be enough to stave off recession.

The US became the focus of recession jitters earlier this year given its importance to global growth. When America sneezes, the rest of the world still catches a cold - even as economic powers in the east rise.

However, Philip Marey, Rabobank's senior US strategist, warns the euphoria on markets over the trade deal has been ""overdone"", predicting the US will enter a recession in the second half of this year.

The deal struck by Beijing and the Trump administration picks the low-hanging fruit of agricultural products and rolling back tariffs but fails to tackle the key sticking points between the two countries, such as intellectual property.

Marey also argues that business investment remains low and the slack left in the US economy - the resources of an economy not being used - is very small, capping the room for growth. A key risk is that business worries feed through into the jobs market and hit the confidence of consumers, whose spending accounts for around 70 per cent of US GDP.

More rate cuts from the Fed would not be able to support growth further, he argues.

""It is really ineffective in supporting business investment and that is where the real bottleneck is at the moment,"" he says.

""For businesses, interest rates are low anyway so that is not their main concern.""

The US election in November will start to come into focus for investors, generating another source of uncertainty for businesses.

Signs of a recession brewing in the US could severely dent Donald Trump's chances given the strong economy is seen as stopping his approval rating sliding any lower.

Four more years of Trump will increase the risk of another trade standoff but some of his Democratic challengers are equally problematic for businesses and investors.

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - who are currently polling in second and third place ahead of the Democratic primaries - are two leftist populists with plans to radically redistribute wealth and take on Wall Street.

Citi global chief economist Catherine Mann says uncertainty from trade and politics ""matters for the global economy"".

""The several risks that have been weighing on the global outlook have not dissipated, and there is a non-small probability that these intensify in 2020.""

While most investment banks believe the threat of an immediate downturn has been pushed back, she warns that the ""risk of recession still does loom over the economy"".

The relief from a prolonged and economically damaging period of uncertainty in the UK could also be brief.

Even with the Brexit deadlock broken, economists expect growth in the UK to be tepid again this year, slowing further from around 1.3 to 1.1 per cent.

With the prime minister insisting on a final trade deal with the EU being agreed before the end of the year, more uncertainty could plague businesses and the UK economy. No-deal Brexit worries could return in the second half of the year.

Berenberg UK economist Kallum Pickering is more optimistic, predicting that growth will hit 1.8 per cent this year after being boosted by the fiscal stimulus promised by the Conservatives.

""An orderly Brexit can lift confidence and spending in the next two years after more than three years of heightened uncertainty and gradually softening momentum,"" he says.

Economists expect much of the business investment lost over the last three years to return but estimates of how much can be lured back vary from around a quarter to a half. Some of the investment will be lost forever, however.

Torsten Bell, chief executive of think tank the Resolution Foundation, warns that Britain's buoyant jobs market could turn in 2020. This could weaken the economic boost provided by record employment levels and shoppers enjoying their biggest pay rises since the last recession.

""Our best guess is that 2020 will be very different from the last few years,"" Bell says. ""We may well see a welcome return to record pay levels, but a less welcome retreat from record employment, with worrying signs including falling vacancies and rising youth unemployment.""

Meanwhile the eurozone economy is expected to be weighed down again by Germany in 2020, with the impotent ECB unable to provide much stimulus and Northern European governments refusing to boost spending.

China, which has been hit hardest in the industrial recession triggered by the trade war, is also expected to slow further. City forecasters are predicting its growth will sink below the symbolic 6 per cent mark despite Beijing's huge fiscal and monetary stimulus efforts to pep up the economy.

While most economists believe a recession will now be avoided in 2020, the ability of policymakers and central bankers to revive growth is severely limited, if one does strike.

The world economy is facing at the very least a prolonged period of stubbornly slow growth that will be difficult to escape.

The last month of the year was a busy one for the courts in Wales.

Those locked up last month include a man who brutally murdered a charity worker and a rapist who attacked a woman as she walked home after a night out.

Here are the faces of the criminals who have been locked up in Wales during the past month.

The paedophile began grooming what he thought were young girls online just weeks after getting out of prison for similar offending.

Miller sent pictures of his penis to someone he believed to be a 12-year-old girl and even booked a hotel room for a rendezvous using a secret smartphone the authorities knew nothing about.

But the 53-year-old was in fact communicating with a paedophile hunter group who later confronted him in the street and detained him until police arrived.

The 38-year-old secretly copied hard drives while transferring shoppers’ data from their old devices to new ones which they had bought from the retail giant.

He then viewed customers’ photographs – including a teenage girl’s school prom and pictures of women's breasts – at his home.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard his deception was uncovered when police raided his property and seized a number of his electronic devices.

Take a look inside the businesses of these five YouTube creators:","It appears that Caterpillar’s cost cutting will have some benefits in the new year, at least according to one report.

Zack’s Equity Research reports that although the company projects lower sales than last year, some of the more recent efforts to save will eventually pay off.

Caterpillar has taken steps to reduce production to match dealer demand and will proactively increase production once order levels improve, according to the report.

This report comes after a rough stretch for the company. Retail sales for the three months ending in November remained stagnant, the worst three month stretch in 2019. According to the report, Caterpillar’s 2019 sales growth was confined in the single-digit territory this year, numbers that haven’t been seen since 2017.

Revealed: Adelaide property bargains for under $130k

Buyer frenzy leads to new sales record for Torrensville

It is listed with Harcourts Gawler and has an advertised price guide of $770,000 to $810,000.

Selling agent David Washington said the property had received dozens of emails and had been incredibly popular online.

“We’re trying to organise VIP viewings, it’s had 12,000 views on social media and it’s still going,” he said.

Mr Washington said the property was one of Gawler’s hidden gems and offered a fantastic lifestyle change.

“It’s a beautiful house, it’s in a lovely part of Willaston,” he said.

“We’re seeing mainly business owners and families within Gawler and surrounds show interest.”

The home features three bedrooms – the master featuring a huge dressing room and modern ensuite – a spacious kitchen, a formal lounge, a family and dining area, and a large family bathroom.

The rear of the home is where you will find the party, complete with an outdoor kitchen, a rustic pergola, a spa with a projector screen and a detached studio.

The property also has an out house, a four-car garage and a cubby house that’s sure to be popular with the kids.

Mr Washington said the home had been a labour of love for the owners, who have renovated it for about 15 years.

“It’s on almost an acre block,” he said.

“The original part of the house is a stand out, with original ceilings and a wide hallway. It’s a big house and it’s still got all its character.

“Plus, it’s straight onto the expressway, you don’t have to go through Gawler and it’s close to schools and about 35 minutes to Adelaide.”","Very little change in the AAC Basketball power rankings before conference games, how do the teams stack up going into the new year?

AAC Basketball has been extremely up and down to start the season, things haven’t quite gone to expectation for everyone but it sets up what should be a great conference schedule. We’ve seen drama in Memphis with James Wiseman leaving school to turn pro and teams building their tournament resumes.

There are two AAC teams in the AP Top 25 Poll this week with Memphis coming in at nine and Wichita State joining the rankings at 24. Houston also received some votes in this week’s poll following their win against Washington.

Things didn’t look great to start the season but they’ve turned it around down the stretch with some big wins.

Conference play is a different stage, every game is important for these teams for seeding in the AAC tournament and there’s a lot of teams capable of winning that.

159,160,Local MMA fighter making professional debut in Millersburg,Ohio ranks among top 10 states for property tax rates,"MILLERSBURG — Lucas Mast was looking for a good workout.



He found it in mixed martial arts.



Mast, a barber in Berlin, will make his professional MMA fighting debut Jan. 11 as part of an Honor Fighting Championship 11-bout card at the Harvest Ridge Event Center in Millersburg.



""I always wanted to wrestle but I never got the chance to,"" said Mast, a 2014 graduate of Hiland where he played basketball for the Hawks. ""When I started this barber business in Berlin, my (eventual) coach stopped in looking for a job. I was looking to get into something that would give me a good workout, and once I got into MMA, I realized I really like it. And once I started fighting, I realized I was pretty good. I kept going and fell in love with the sport.""



He is coached by Jose Burgos, who has been training fighters part time for nearly six years. He has a training facility (Common Grounds Grappling Club) in Nashville, Ohio. Triway graduate Eddie Flinner is another fighter with local roots, fighting out of club.



""Lucas is an all-around mixed martial artists,"" Burgos said. ""He is good everywhere the fight goes. One area he is particularly slick is with his hands. He has good movement and footwork, and because of that he can really sit down on his punches.""



Mast is 7-1 in his young career, but the event at Harvest Ridge marks his professional debut.



Burgos and Mast came together sort of by accident.



""I came into his barbershop in Berlin looking for a job as a barber,"" Burgos said. ""He found out that I fight and was a teacher, and I found out he wanted to fight.""



That’s how things started.



""He asked if I thought he’d be any good, and I told him if he trains hard and does what I tell him to do, I can get him to a certain point,"" Burgos said. ""He’s done that.""



The Honor Fighting Championship was founded in 2017. Event promoter Jeremy Caudill and Melanie Lockard, who lost a battle with cancer in October, were introduced to Michelle Kring and Scott Corbin, who have been in the MMA world for over 10 years. They came up with Honor Fighting Championship, a platform for fighters to showcase their skills.



""Lucas is a fighter I have personally watched closely because he has heart and what it takes to take him all the way,"" Caudill said. ""He is a business man; very smart. He is young and he knows what he wants and goes and gets it.""



Caudill said he wanted to have a military theme with Honor Fighting Championship to honor all military people past, present and future.



""We have signed with Vet Tix to give vets free tickets to our show,"" he said. ""Honor Fighting Championship quickly became a big deal in the MMA world in Ohio.""



Caudill brought showman skills to the show, adding lights, music and a certain element that made Honor the place to fight.



""Within our first year of business we were already planning on doing a big show at Cleveland Nautica's Jacobs Pavilion,"" he said. ""That show was a big success. Honor did a show in Millersburg last May, and that show was a great turnout. The town welcomed us with open arms.""



He is looking forward to a triumphant return.



The Honor Fighting Championship event at Harvest Ridge Event Center, 8880 state Route 39, gets under way at 5:30 p.m.

The People's Bank of China announced that the reserve requirement ratio for financial institutions would be lowered by 50 basis points.

164,165,Crisis on Infinite Earths Gave the Arrowverse Its Best Superman Line,24: Why David Palmer Was Killed Off In Season 5,"Brandon Routh's character in Crisis on Infinite Earths gave the Arrowverse its best Superman line yet. Though Routh isn't the Arrowverse's main version of the Man of Steel, he's already become one of the most talked-about characters in the crossover.

Crisis on Infinite Earths features three different versions of the flagship DC hero: Tom Welling's Clark Kent from Smallville, Brandon Routh's Kingdom Come Superman, and of course, the Arrowverse's own Superman (Tyler Hoechlin). Routh's character comes from a timeline where key Superman characters such as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Perry White were murdered. Superman is identified as a ""hopeless Kryptonian"" and one of the seven paragons capable of stopping the Anti-Monitor (LaMonica Garrett) from destroying the multiverse. Superman is one of the sole survivors of Earth-1's destruction, but a last-second twist sees him die at the hands of Earth-38's Lex Luthor (Jon Cryer).

During the third installment of Crisis on Infinite Earths, Earth-38's Lois Lane (Elizabeth Tulloch) asks Superman why he wears a black House of El emblem, as opposed to the traditional yellow. Superman responds, ""Even in the darkest times, hope cuts through. Hope is the light that lifts us out of darkness"". It's a very Superman-esque line, and it perfectly represents an ideal that all interpretations of the Big Blue Boy Scout should uphold. After all, Superman is a character whose goal is to bring hope to the universe, so this is exactly the sort of quote one should expect from such a symbolic hero.

Every show and movie with the Man of Steel needs an inspirational Superman line, and it seems fitting that it would be Routh's Clark - not Hoechlin's - who delivers it, especially when considering the background of his character. The Kingdom Come Superman has a much more tragic backstory than other portrayals of the character, so the idea that Superman is still able to hold on to hope despite everything that he's lost makes the moment even more moving.

Also, it's revealed in the second chapter of Crisis on Infinite Earths that the Kingdom Come Superman is in fact the same Clark Kent played by Routh in Superman Returns, which means that he's also the same character played by Christopher Reeve in the original Superman movies. Reeve's portrayal of Superman is easily the most iconic and most beloved live-action version of Superman, so it certainly seemed necessary for Crisis on Infinite Earths to do him justice. Routh's Superman has been so well-received that fans are wondering if The CW made a mistake in not giving him his own show.

Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker Had Darth Vader Bounty Hunter Cameo","In the 24 season 5 premiere, the FOX series made the shocking decision to kill David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), but why? President Palmer was easily one of the show's most beloved characters, and is still referred to by many as one of the best TV presidents.

Over the course of nine seasons, 24 went through quite a few presidents. Some, like Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones), helped Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) thwart terrorist plots, while others, such as Noah Daniels (Powers Boothe) and Charles Logan (Gregory Itzin), were secretly the masterminds. One president in particular, David Palmer, stood out as a character who was a friend and ally to Jack and a president who knew how to handle a crisis. Haysbert was a series regular for three seasons, and was reduced to a recurring role for the show's fourth season, since at this point he was no longer President of the United States.

24 opened season 5 with a bang by killing off David Palmer. It happened when Palmer was visiting his brother, Wayne (D.B. Woodside). During a conversation with Wayne, Palmer stands in front of a window and is suddenly assassinated by a then-unknown assailant. Jack, who is framed for Palmer's assassination, sets out to find the killers and learns of their connection to a much bigger terrorist plot. It was later revealed that Palmer was killed because he was close to uncovering the truth about their plan and the people involved. According to Dennis Haysbert, killing off Palmer wasn't his decision, though some may have assumed that Haysbert wanted to leave because he had recently landed the lead role in CBS' The Unit. However, this was not the case.

Palmer was no longer a main character, so this wasn't an issue. In fact, Haysbert has been adamant about not wanting Palmer to die. Haysbert says that he refused to return to film Palmer's death scene for a ""great many months"", but was eventually convinced by the showrunner to come back (via New York Magazine). The writers and the showrunner deemed his death necessary for the benefit of the story. Palmer was told that his death was needed to kick off the story for 24 season 5.

Palmer's death did have the desired effect on the show, as it had a tremendous impact on the main characters and set the stage for the rest of the season. It also affected viewers, who were upset by the death of such a beloved character, and this is actually the reason why Haysbert was so hesitant to do the scene. He felt that there was no need to kill a character who was ""so loved by everybody"", and that he now regrets his decision to return. This sentiment is echoed by 24 fans. 24 had no shortage of major deaths, but there may not be any more memorable than David Palmer's shocking assassination in season 5.

After reaching out to touch a child, a nearby woman seized his hand, jerking the religious leader around – a yank that appeared to cause him pain.

After slapping her hand several times, the Pope freed himself of her grip. The usually serene Francis scowled as he walked away.

According to reports, the Pope later acknowledged that he had “lost patience” with the admiring pilgrim.

Francis has a history of repelling unwanted contact. In March, he was criticized for refusing to allow members of the faithful to kiss his papal ring during a visit to an Italian shrine.

167,168,"Trump signs law increasing max robocall fine to $10,000","Trump signs the TRACED Act, the first federal anti-robocall law","President Trump has signed a law increasing fines on spammy robocalls and requiring phone service providers to begin authenticating calls across networks.

The Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act (TRACED Act) was signed on Monday, after Congress approved the landmark bill earlier this month to give the federal government new abilities to go after illegal robocallers. Fines can now reach $10,000 per call. The law also requires major carriers such as AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile to use a new technology called STIR/SHAKEN to help customers know if they’re being targeted by a robocaller with a spoofed number.

“I applaud Congress for working in a bipartisan manner to combat illegal robocalls and malicious caller ID spoofing,” Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement. Pai added he’s glad the agency “has a longer statute of limitations” to pursue scammers.

Carriers have already begun to deploy the STIR/SHAKEN technology in anticipation of the new law, though support is still limited. Eventually, companies like AT&T and Verizon should be able to verify calls between their networks, ensuring a call is coming from a real, authentic number.

Trump’s signing of the TRACED Act into law is just another step in the ongoing battle the FCC has taken to fight robocalls under Pai. The commissioner announced over the summer that the FCC would move to make it illegal to send spoofed calls or texts from overseas. Congress passed new rules in 2018 allowing the commission to do so.","How to fight robocalls: The basics You can't block all the spam phone calls, but blocking some is better than blocking none. Read more: https://zd.net/2GGv83H

President Trump this week signed the TRACED Act, the first federal law designed to curb unwanted robocalls. With the problem of robocalls running rampant, the legislation passed with strong support in both the Democratic-led House and the Republican-led Senate.

The legislation takes on the problem from multiple fronts. First, it gives the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) more authority to go after the scammers responsible for unwanted robocalls. It allows the FCC to go after scammers the first time they break the law and extends the statute of limitations by up to four years in some cases. It also ups the financial penalties against robocallers.

Additionally, it encourages stronger Justice Department criminal prosecution of unlawful robocalls by requiring the FCC to provide the DOJ with evidence of criminal robocall violations.

Next, the law requires all carriers to eventually implement new technologies to authenticate caller-ID information, preventing call spoofing -- at no additional line-item cost to consumers. As Congress notes in its summary of the law, many illegal robocalls use call spoofing so the call appears to be coming from a trusted number.

The FCC is already planning to mandate that carriers implement its SHAKEN/STIR authentication system to help combat robocalls. In March, AT&T and Comcast announced that they successfully tested the first SHAKEN/STIR-authenticated call between two different telecom networks.

Meanwhile, the law additionally says consumers should also get access to robocall blocking at no additional line item charge on their bill.

The law also requires the FCC to put new limits on robocalls that are legal, even without consumer consent -- such as calls from financial institutions regarding potentially fraudulent transactions. Specifically, the law calls for new limits on the kinds of organizations that may make such calls, who can receive such calls and the number of calls allowed under the exemption.

The TRACE Act also clarifies that when a person gets a new phone number, robocallers cannot keep calling to look for the person previously had that number.

It also requires the FCC to work to stop one-ring scams and helps the FCC and carriers trace back the origin of unlawful robocalls.

The law passed in the House earlier this month by a vote of 417 to 3, and it passed in the Senate by voice vote.

During the legislative debate, Congress put out a white paper with data on the extent of the robocall problem: In 2018, there were an estimated 48 billion robocalls, up over 64 percent since 2016, according to YouMail. Meanwhile, First Orion predicts that this year 44.6 percent of all calls to mobile phones will be scam calls.

In a statement, the cloud communications company Twilio said the legislation should have a notable impact: ""The law will aid efforts among law enforcement authorities, government agencies and the communications industry to stop the bad calls and restore consumers' faith that they will receive the calls they want. With its strong emphasis on the implementation of the SHAKEN/STIR protocol and consumer protection efforts, we expect to see a dramatic change in the robocall landscape in the next 12 to 18 months.""",1.0,1.3333333333333333,1.0,1.3333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,1.3333333333333333,1.0," The TRACED Act was signed by President Trump on Monday .

168,169,A great decade for the Blackhawks ends with a win in Calgary,"Kane scores twice, leads Blackhawks to 5-3 win over Flames","× A great decade for the Blackhawks ends with a win in Calgary

CALGARY – Over the past few days, many reflected back on what’s been the greatest decade in the history of Blackhawks’ hockey.

The team was in the playoffs every year except the last two and brought home three Stanley Cups, which were the first for the franchise since 1961.

While it hasn’t been the best of ends to this ten-year stretch, the team was able to string together a few victories to finish the decade strong.

That included a 5-3 win on Tuesday evening in Calgary just an hour-and-a-half before the 2020s began. It was a contest of momentum against the Flames, with the Blackhawks jumping out to an early four-goal lead before watching their hosts put up a big rally.

A goal in the closing moments of the second period and two more in the third got the lead down to one, but fittingly Patrick Kane was able to seal the Blackhawks’ victory.

Arguably the team’s player of the decade, the forward completed his four-point night with his second goal into the empty net to complete the victory. It was the team’s third-straight victory and puts the Blackhawks over the .500 mark at 18-17-6 as 2019 comes to an end.

With a couple of memorable saves along the way, Robin Lehner turned in another yeoman’s effort in net, stopping 41-of-44 shots to give the Blackhawks one more win in an incredible decade.","CALGARY, Alberta (AP) — Patrick Kane had two goals and two assists, and the Chicago Blackhawks raced out to a four-goal lead and held on to beat the Calgary Flames 5-3 on Tuesday night.

Kane set up goals by Olli Maatta at 4:14 and Alex Debrincat at 5:35 and then made it 3-0 at 12:44 of the first period when he cut across the slot and beat David Rittich with a wrist shot from 30 feet out.

Kane’s 21st goal of the season was the 377th of his career, tying him with Denis Savard for fourth on the Blackhawks’ all-time list. The top three are Bobby Hull (604), Stan Makita (541) and Steve Larmer (406).

Kane’s second of the game was an empty-netter at 19:59 of the third.

Kane finishes the decade as the NHL’s top scorer with 802 points, just ahead of Sidney Crosby (788).

Dylan Strome also scored for Chicago (18-17-6), which has won three straight and five of six.

Sam Bennett, Michael Frolik and Sean Monahan scored for Calgary (20-17-5). The Flames are winless in their last five at home. (0-4-1).

Robin Lehner was excellent in net for the Blackhawks, winning his sixth straight start to improve to 12-6-4. He finished with 41 saves.

169,170,Alaska Senate President in Spotlight With Dividend Fight,Judge blocks NC voter ID law,"By BECKY BOHRER, Associated Press

JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — During her first year as Alaska Senate president, Cathy Giessel won over one-time political adversaries and angered some within her own party for her willingness to buck Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a fellow Republican, on key pieces of his agenda.

Giessel's ascension to the role just three other women have held coincided with Dunleavy's 2018 election. She was among those who argued cuts proposed by the governor were too much, too fast, and that the formula he wanted to follow for paying checks to residents from the state's oil-wealth fund, the Alaska Permanent Fund, was no longer workable.

Tuckerman Babcock, a former state GOP chair and former Dunleavy chief of staff, said Giessel's position on the dividend changed.

“That's one issue, and the other is, to be so publicly, adamantly at odds with the governor is just bizarre,” he said, noting he would not support her again.

Giessel said as Senate leader, she's an easy target.

Rather than dictating views to her 14-member caucus, which includes a Democrat, Giessel said she gives them room to wrestle with issues to reach agreement, or not. Her caucus was sharply divided on the dividend last year, which she said reflected the electorate and divisions within her party.

Giessel said the dividend has been one of the most divisive statewide issues she's seen. It's expected to be a major focus during the next legislative session, which begins Jan. 21.

“But I do believe ... we will, after all of this vigorous conversation, come to a good conclusion,"" she said.

In 2016, as she faced re-election, Giessel supported then-Sen. Dunleavy's call to restore the portion of the dividend cut by Gov. Bill Walker as the state struggled with a budget deficit. Giessel recently said she felt the issue should not be decided by one person.

Lawmakers had a chance to override Walker's actions but didn't. A legal challenge ultimately was decided in his favor.

In 2018, lawmakers began tapping permanent fund earnings, long used to pay dividends, to help cover government costs. They also passed a law seeking to limit withdrawals from earnings for government and dividends.

Dunleavy has supported using a decades-old dividend formula that many lawmakers see as unsustainable and haven't followed in recent years. Giessel has called for a formula change.

During her race, “I never said I supported these massive-sized PFDs,"" she said, referring to the checks. “I supported a full legislative discussion of the subject and not just keeping the money in the earnings reserve account but actually using it to balance our budgets.”

Lawmakers settled on a 2019 dividend that equaled $1,606. Under the formula, it would have been $2,910, according to the Department of Revenue.

House Speaker Bryce Edgmon said his relationship with Giessel mainly consisted of passing hellos before she became Senate president but has blossomed into a friendship and trusted working relationship. He said she has come into her own as a leader.

“She sticks to her values, her principles. In the face of flack by some in her own party, and maybe some Alaskans along the way, she didn't flinch, and I really respected her for that,"" said Edgmon, an independent.

Giessel and Edgmon joined in challenging the administration in a dispute over school funding and Dunleavy's pick of a special session location.

Giessel was born in territorial Alaska, in Fairbanks, where she was raised, the oldest of four children. Her father was a pilot who often took her on trips to rural Alaska. Her mother went to law school after raising the family.

Giessel wanted to study political science in college but said her mother urged her to study something “practical,” like nursing. Her mother also urged her to intern for then-U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens, which she said she did.

Giessel met her husband Richard in Michigan, where she attended college. After nursing school, when he suggested they marry, she told him he'd find her in Alaska, where they eventually settled.

She put her nursing career on hold for 12 years to raise and homeschool their children, and later earned a master's degree.

Giessel has long been involved in Republican politics and served as a state GOP vice chair.

After working on campaigns and wanting to make a difference with policy, she was elected to the Senate in 2010. For two years, she was part of a conservative, four-member minority.

Oil and gas were hot topics, and she “made up her mind that she was going to know everything that there was to know about it,” said Republican Sen. John Coghill, who was in that caucus and is on the current GOP-led majority's leadership team.

“Man, oh man. She got hold of something and became a formidable force because of her tenaciousness,” he said.

During her legislative career, Giessel has often attended hearings of committees she doesn't serve on, taking notes, likening it to soaking up all she can in a classroom.

Giessel became Senate Resources Committee chair in 2013, after Republicans wrested control of the Senate from a bipartisan majority. She said she wanted the job after seeing how North Slope communities she visited as a nurse had benefited from oil development.

Senate Democratic Leader Tom Begich said Giessel once was a political adversary but last year said they expressed a desire to work together, in their leadership roles. The Anchorage Democrat said he and Giessel have different ideas but share the goal of a “stable, sustainable Alaska"" with opportunities.

“I have no doubt about that, and that makes it easy to work with her,” he said.","RALEIGH — The federal judge who blocked the newest version of North Carolina’s voter identification law cited the state’s “sordid history of racial discrimination and voter suppression” as she ordered officials not to enforce the law in 2020.

U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Biggs’ decision was released Tuesday and prevents North Carolina from requiring voters to provide identification starting in 2020. The Republican leaders of the state House and Senate, however, have asked North Carolina’s Department of Justice to appeal.

The federal court advised last week that Biggs would formally block the photo ID requirement until a lawsuit filed by state NAACP and others is resolved. Her decision provided insight into why she blocked the law, which she said was similar to a 2013 law that a federal appeals court struck down in 2016.

That court said the photo ID and other voter restrictions were approved with intentional racial discrimination in mind, and Biggs said the newest version of the law was no different in that respect.

“North Carolina has a sordid history of racial discrimination and voter suppression stretching back to the time of slavery, through the era of Jim Crow, and, crucially, continuing up to the present day,” Biggs wrote.

Legislators received a breakdown of voter behavior by race before passing the 2016 law and used that data to target African American voters, the court wrote in striking down that law. The defendants said there’s no evidence of similar behavior before the most recent voter ID law.

But the same key lawmakers championed both bills, Biggs wrote. “ … they need not had racial data in hand to still have it in mind,” the ruling says.

The approval of the new version, known as S.B. 824, was “procedurally unobjectional,” Biggs wrote. But its closeness in time to the previous version; the fact that many of the same legislators were involved in both bills; the use of “unconstitutionally gerrymandered maps” and other issues “indicate that something was amiss,” she wrote.

The legislative history of the bill, including statements from its supporters, show that “rather than trying to cleanse the discriminatory taint” imbued in the previous voter ID law, lawmakers tried to circumvent state and federal courts, she wrote.

The photo ID law would have been effective with the March 3 primary. But the requirement would have been put into motion sooner than that with mail-in absentee voters, who also would have had to provide an ID copy.

The Rev. T. Anthony Spearman, president of the North Carolina conference of the NAACP, said he was “overjoyed” by Biggs’ decision.

“Quite frankly, tears are coming to my eyes as I read the decision,” he said. Biggs’ “strong language is so appropriate” as the nation approaches the 2020 elections, Spearman said.

“I hope it is something that will encourage people who have not exercised their right to vote to cast their votes,” he said.

After losing one court battle over voter ID, Republicans put a question on the November 2018 ballot enshrining voter ID in the state constitution. The amendment passed with 55% of the vote. The legislature approved a separate law in December 2018 detailing how to implement that amendment. Legal challenges were filed almost immediately.

GOP legislators said they had to enact an ID law because voters had approved one. But Biggs, who was appointed to the bench in 2014 by then-President Barack Obama, said the constitutional amendment was a cover for legislators that allowed them to present themselves as “faithful servants whose hands were tied.”

The argument that lawmakers had to pass this particular bill falls short, she wrote. “While the legislature may had to pass some form of photo voter-ID law, it did not have to enact one which suffers from impermissible defects,” she wrote.

The law did allow for more types of IDs to be used and allowed voters to get a free ID card or fill out a form explaining their “reasonable impediment” to obtaining one.

But legislators rejected an amendment allowing the use of public assistance IDs, which Biggs described as “particularly suspect.”

Republican legislators have urged the state DOJ to seek a stay of the temporary injunction, saying Biggs’ ruling was “inappropriate.”

Their attorneys sent a letter Monday saying it’s “imperative that you seek a stay of Judge Biggs’ injunction immediately to avoid irreparable harm to the state.”

In the 18th century, the Jewish community in the province grew in size, and made up a significant portion of the city of Warsaw’s population. In 1806, a cemetery was established outside the city’s okopy, or trenches. As the city grew, the cemetery came to be inside the city limits and Okopowa Street now marks the original course of the trenches.

The cemetery covers 33.4 hectares, and an estimated 200,000 people have been buried on its grounds. People buried at the cemetery include spiritual and political leaders, artists, businesspeople, and thousands of nameless victims of the Warsaw ghetto.

In 1914, Warsaw’s Jewish population numbered more than 330,000. In 1946, after World War II ended, it numbered about 18,000. This cemetery is one of the few remaining pieces of material heritage of the Jewish people in Poland. Much like the Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague, one can find heaps and rows of headstones crowded together. Parts of the Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery look abandoned, with thicket covering the land and vines growing up to the trees. The cemetery also includes a number of decorated tombs and mausoleums. You can still see many historical slabs and tombstones with ornaments and symbolic reliefs.

Until World War II, the cemetery included a funeral house and synagogue. The area was recognized as a historical monument in 1973 and was put under protection. Today, in addition to being in active use for burials, the cemetery is an important source of heritage for the local Jewish community. Many Jewish birth, marriage, and death certificates were destroyed during World War II, and information from the gravestones is often used in genealogical research.","Citizen Action of New York Celebrates Enactment of Pretrial Justice Reforms

Albany, NY — In response to the January 1, 2020 enactment of historic pretrial justice reforms, Amy Jones, Community Organizer, Citizen Action of New York, said:



“Today, New Yorkers across the state are celebrating enactment of our new bail, discovery and speedy trial laws. People power, years of fierce advocacy and the resolve of our partners and elected allies have delivered a powerful blow to an injustice system that has criminalized race and poverty, destroyed lives and caged legally innocent people for generations. These reforms are long overdue, and help move us towards a “justice” system that lives up to its name.



“This day is especially meaningful to me, because I personally fought on the frontlines to pass these laws. I have also suffered behind bars because I couldn’t afford the price tag on my freedom. I have been coerced into plea deals without knowing about the evidence against me. I know what the human costs of pretrial injustice are – and so I know it’s no exaggeration to say that countless lives will be saved as a result of these new laws.



“Mass incarceration has always been justified in the name of “public safety” – but we know from data and lived experience that bail and pretrial detention have never kept us safe. We also know that the old pretrial laws were weaponized against Black, Brown and poor people to maintain gross power imbalances and disparity in the system. The things that truly create safe and healthy communities are people being home with their children, keeping their homes, staying in school, earning money and remaining a part of community. The new pretrial laws help get us there.

“To be clear, there is much more work to be done.

Fans of Coleen Rooney believe her New Year's message may be hinting at her feud with Rebekah Vardy.

Last year, Coleen claimed that someone using Rebekah's Instagram account leaked false stories.

Coleen posted a statement on social media on how she set up an Instagram trap to catch a 'close friend' who was reportedly leaking information to The S*n newspaper.

And in a dramatic finale, she claimed it was from the Instagram account of Rebekah Vardy - wife of Leicester City and England striker, Jamie Vardy.

The mum-of-four said she had suspicions for years that someone was sharing stories with the newspaper and so devised a plan to catch the person out.

Coleen said she closed her Instagram Stories to every single one of her followers, except Rebekah Vardy's account.

She then released three false stories on her Instagram, all of which later appeared in the reviled newspaper.

This led the 33-year-old to conclude the source could only be from Rebekah Vardy's account.

Rebekah later released her own statement in retaliation denying the claims and calling them ""disgusting"", saying that several people had had access to her account over the years.

At the time, she also said she was seeking legal advice over Coleen's claims.

On New Year's Day, Coleen shared a message with her followers wishing them health and happiness.

But one part of her tweet saw fans speculate about last year's iconic Twitter spat.

Coleen wrote: ""Wishing you all a very happy New year.... health and happiness. I hope 2020 is exactly what you all want it to be and more.""

It was the '....' which led fans to believe she was referencing her earlier tweet 'It's...Rebekah Vardy's account.'

Joe Joinson joked: ""It's....... The New Year!!"", whilst another fan simply replied with the detective emoji in reference to #WAGathaChristie.

Another said: ""Cheers Miss Marple!""

And Katie commented: ""It’s............ Coleen Rooney x""

Coleen's full statement said: ""For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal instagram account has been consistently informing The S*n newspaper of my private posts and stories.

""There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.

""After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.

""To try and prove this I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except One account (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven't had stories on there for a while.)

""Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the newspaper. And you know what they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.

""It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account it's come from.

(Image: PA)

""I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.

""It's Rebekah Vardy's account.""

And Rebekah replied with a statement directed at Coleen on Twitter and said: ""As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this.

""I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me to over the years can vouch for.

""If you thought this was happening you could have told me and I could have changed passwords to see if it stopped.

""Over the years various people have had access to my insta and just this week I found out I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.

""I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?

""I liked you a lot a Coleen and I'm so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I'm heavily pregnant.

Every coach who was asked about the top candidate for Orange County girls volleyball coach of the year had the same reply.

The No. 1 choice was Isaac Owens of Esperanza.

Owens coached the Aztecs to the CIF-Southern Section Division 2 championship and a 29-8 record.

ALL-COUNTY VOLLEYBALL | Player of the Year | Coach of the Year | All-County Teams

Those results and the support of his peers makes Owens the Orange County girls volleyball coach of the year.

Esperanza defeated Murrieta Valley in five sets in the CIF-SS Division 2 championship match at Cerritos College. The Aztecs lost the first two sets of the Division 2 final, and had lost the second set by a larger margin than the first. Owens managed to rally the team, and the team rallied to win three sets in a row to capture Esperanza’s third CIF-SS girls volleyball title.

Owens, 49, has coached at Esperanza since 2001. He has coached the boys and girls teams there during his tenure, and since 2014 has exclusively been the girls coach.

Owens played his high school volleyball at Huntington Beach.

Esperanza had excellent players this season.

“Elyse Stowell was amazing,” said Owens of the junior outside hitter who was the CIF-SS Division 2 player of the year. “(Senior setter) Maddy Harkey did a wonderful job for us, (outside hitter) Julia Waugh was outstanding as a freshman with her ability to pass and hit, and our junior middle Taylor Jones was great, too.”",2.0,4.0,1.3333333333333333,3.6666666666666665,3.333333333333333,2.6666666666666665,1.6666666666666667," In 2019, our newsroom opted to really expand photo journalism on the site and offer readers a more visual way of connecting with civics and arts across the county .

Landry's, Inc. — the restaurant chain from local billionaire Tilman Fertitta — is alerting the public of a recent security incident involving payment processing that may have affected some customers.

According to a statement released on Dec. 31, customers’ payment cards could have been mistakenly swiped by waitstaff on the order-entry systems instead of the point-of-sale terminals used for payment processing.

INCREASING: As data flows more freely, incidence of breaches increases for businesses large and small

Landry's said an investigation identified “malware designed to access payment card data from cards used in person on systems at its restaurants,” but that the system’s encryption technology was effective in preventing access to payment-card data when cards were used on those encryption devices.

The company implemented payment processing with end-to-end encryption technology in 2016, a year after it faced a massive data breach.

In addition to the encrypted payment devices, Landry's also uses order-entry programs with card readers that allow waitstaff to enter kitchen orders. In ""rare circumstances,"" according to Landry's, payment cards may have been swiped through those devices between March 13, 2019 to October 17, 2019. A ""small number"" of locations were reportedly affected as early as January 2019.

Texas has long faced the destruction feral hogs can have on land and wildlife. Now feral hogs' rampant damage is stretching as far north as Canada, with particularly prominent populations in U.S. northern border states, including Montana and North Dakota, the New York Times reports.

""In the past 30 years, the hogs have expanded their range to 38 states from 17,"" according to the Times.

And this spread isn't natural, it's being caused by people, scientists explain. Dale Nolte, manager of the feral swine program at the Department of Agriculture, told the outlet that there's ""every reason to believe they are being moved in the backs of pickup trucks and released to create hunting opportunities.”

NATURE ODDITIES: The weirdest Texas game warden stories of 2019

While Texas has developed creative hunting practices to stave off the swine epidemic, from air balloon strikes to the ""HeliBacon,"" a helicopter that can be chartered for pricey hog-hunt excursions. However, for some states, hunting creates an incentive for hosting hog populations rather than a solution.

In those places, ""people to distribute feral pigs for sport,"" the Times explains. ""Hunting makes the animals warier and scatters sounders, or family groups, which go on to multiply in new family groups.""

The swine have been capable of surviving the extreme winters in northern states and have been steadily multiplying. Their effects have not yet been as carefully documented as they are in the south. What experts do know is that state officials should plan to contain hog populations sooner rather than later.

This rings especially true and urgent in recent months.

These hogs are not typically known to be predatory, but a November encounter proved deadly for a woman in Anahuac, Texas. Christine Rollins was found dead with animal bites on her body. The Jefferson County Coroner's Office determined it was a feral hog assault that caused Rollin's death. However, that's an extreme and rare example of what these swine can do. If they cause human casualties it's usually by spreading disease through contaminated waters, including E. coli outbreaks in produce.

It's more common that the invasive species attacks ecosystems rather than people. They destabilize habitats and ravage private properties, agricultural crops — to the tune of $52 million in one recent finding —and wetlands by trampling on them. Even worse, they breed quickly. Their gestation period is roughly 120 days and they can breed as young as six months old.

Because of their negative effects on the environment and on communities, officials in The Woodlands — where this issue is particularly pronounced — are hosting an educational seminar on Feb. 20 at Houston Advanced Research Center (HARC), 8801 Gosling Road, in The Woodlands.

Officers received a call at 3:43 p.m. about a possibly suicidal man armed with a handgun in the area of Orange Avenue and Palmer Street, according to police.

An officer in the area found a suspect matching the description. Police said the man, identified as Steven Fernandez of San Diego, fled on foot while firing several shots at the officer, taking cover in a garage in the 200 block of Knox Place where police said he then shot at a resident.

Fernandez was confined to the garage, and a SWAT team was called in an attempt to negotiate with Fernandez.

As negotiations took place, police said Fernandez displayed a gun and was subsequently shot and injured by an officer.

Fernandez was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a police officer and was taken to the hospital for treatment. He is expected to survive.

Police said two handguns were recovered at the scene.

No officers or civilians were injured in the shootings.

Shelly Ehbrecht spent the last day of 2019 reflecting on her more than four decades on the job.

“It feels surreal; it feels bittersweet. I’m going to cry,” she said as she wrapped up her last shift at Surrey Memorial Hospital.

“It’s time to go. I’ve had a great run for 44 years, great experiences.”

Ehbrecht began her career at the old Grace Hospital, now known as B.C. Women’s Hospital.

“The head nurse that I had initially was like an army head nurse,” she said.

“It was important to bounce dimes on the beds and the bed-making was really an important part of my job.”

Her expertise in bed-making is rivalled only by the depth of her knowledge of the maternity unit, having cared for thousands of families over the years as they welcomed the newest members of their families.

She says one of the biggest changes she has seen during his career is the switch to single-care rooms for new moms.

“I loved the single-room philosophy at Women’s,” she said.

“I worked in their unit when it started. There was a lot of controversy because it was a new thing. Women can come in, families can come in. They labour, deliver, they have their postpartum in the same room.

“This is such a much better model of care — yeah, happy little thing.”

Her final shift was filled with heartfelt goodbyes from colleagues who will miss her — and she says she will miss them, too.

“I work with some great people, great doctors, great nurses,” she said.

Nurses will continue to deliver up to 400 babies a month. It’s the part of the job that Ehbrecht says she’ll remember most.

“It’s such a privilege and an honour to be with a family when they’re experiencing that labour and delivery,” Ehbrecht said.

“I just feel so honoured that I could be a part of it.”

“It is truly an honour to publicly recognize and celebrate these outstanding Londoners,” Mayor Holder said.

“Their work, their commitment to community-building, and their kindness inspire all of us.”

“London is a more dynamic, and a more caring city as a result of their efforts.”

The Mayor of London’s annual Honour List was introduced in 1976 with recognition of contributions to the Arts.

Since 1989, categories including Diversity and Race Relations, Heritage, Housing, and Persons with Disabilities have been added.

Recipients are named by City Council on the recommendation of Advisory Committees or community organizations through the City’s Standing Committees.

In 2019, City Council introduced a ‘Distinguished Londoner’ category.

It is meant to recognize no more than four individuals who have made an “outstanding contribution to community collaboration, or acts of good will by giving back to our City.”","He’s been teaching Londoners how to stamp out racism and build bridges for more than two decades, one year giving more than 300 presentations.

Leroy Hibbert was the one called in to train hundreds of London police officers after a blackface scandal opened the force up to criticism.

Now the 48-year-old is being honoured as a “Distinguished Londoner,” a new category on the annual mayor’s New Year’s honour list released Wednesday.

It recognizes 11 Londoners for their achievements and charitable work, including an Olympic bobsled champion and a seven-year-old girl who fought leukemia for much of her short life.

“I just say ‘wow,’ ” Hibbert said when asked about being part of the inaugural group of Distinguished Londoners on the annual roll call.

“I was humbled, I was thankful. Although you do the work because of the love I have for the people, it’s nice to be recognized.”

Hibbert, who was born in Toronto but moved to London as a youngster, does multicultural outreach for LUSO Community Services. He’s seen the city’s population grow and its “cultural and racial makeup” shift dramatically since the 1970s, describing it as “one of the greatest things I’ve seen.”

But that diversity has also sparked challenges, he said.

“There are actually still pockets within the community (where) racism exists, discrimination exists, ethnic misunderstandings also occur,” Hibbert said.

But he said he feels Londoners are increasingly having the tough conversations.

“The racism that has happened maybe 50 to 60 years ago was very blatant,” Hibbert said.

“Now it’s very different in that it’s very subtle. There are a lot of unconscious biases and a lot of micro-aggressions that take place. It’s still very hurtful. It can be exhausting for racialized community members to keep fighting these battles are that are not as ‘in your face,’” he added.

It’s a history London knows well, marked by episodes such as a racial slur hurled at two black actors – in town to appear in a play about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. And as recently as this fall, a Western University student who called out a professor for using the n-word in a lecture faced an onslaught of racist attacks.

But there’s one lesson that keeps Hibbert plugging ahead.

“People can change. That is one thing that’s an encouraging factor for me,” he said.

“Where people are now, isn’t where they’ll end up.”

One of them passed away in her arms.

They all had sickle cell disease.

Joseph said, ""He was never properly diagnosed. Even today it's still an issue in Haiti. They all died in Haiti.""

Joseph who carries the trait for the disease, hopes she can save lives in Haiti through her JayJ Foundation, which she started in memory of her brothers.

She says some area doctors want to help. ""We will be launching the sickle cell initiative where we will be testing newborns and kids up to age 5. And if they do have sickle cell disease, we will be providing them with the necessary medication and treatment.""

Joseph already visits Haiti helping with food and other supplies. Now it will be about sickle cell anemia, a disease that goes beyond her home country.

Dr. Nayf Edress, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist, says, ""Sickle cell anemia is an inherited genetic disorder that affects the red blood cells. It is disproportionately affecting the African American and the Hispanic population.""

Strides made in the U.S. in medications to help those with sickle cell.

""We are really excited. for over four decades we only had the same medications for the last four decades. It's really until last year we had one additional medication and this year that we have two additional medications. Hopefully these will be history in the making that we are witnessing"", said Dr. Edress.

Meanwhile, Joseph hopes to make history by helping kids in Haiti diagnosed with sickle cell have a fighting chance. ""I want to make a difference in one or two however many I can whether it's here and also in Haiti,"" she says.

","One of the worst decisions an underage drinker can make is to get behind the wheel — or to get in the car with a driver that’s been drinking.



On average, the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration says, three in five people will be involved in a crash caused by impaired driving in their lifetime. Also remind children that drug use, vaping and other activities also can cause impairment.



Fast Facts



Consider these alarming facts about drunk driving, according to SAMHSA:



» One in every four teen car crashes involves an underage drinking driver.



» About 800 people are injured in a drunk driving crash every day.



» One person dies every 50 minutes as a result of an impaired crash.



» Thirteen percent of weekend nighttime drivers have marijuana in their system.



» Marijuana users are about 25% more likely to be involved in a crash than a driver with no evidence of marijuana use.



Keeping Kids Safe



Talk to your children, SAMHSA says, early and often. Lay down rules and expectations clearly. Discuss impaired driving whenever your child borrows the car, at dinner, when a child leaves with a friend, running errands, at the grocery store. Everywhere. All the time.



Most importantly, help them build an exit plan. Your child may not know what to do if an impaired person they would normally trust offers them a ride. Let them know it’s OK to say no, and help them think of ways they can find a safe ride home, including:



» Calling a taxi or a rideshare service;



» Calling a sober person; or



» Staying the night where they are.



Also talk to them about how to convince an impaired person not to drive. And remember to model good behavior. If you drink, never drink and drive.



It’s Preventable



Impaired driving is an entirely preventable crime. And it is a real crime with real consequences that won’t just go away when you turn 18. Every state in the U.S. has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to underage intoxicated driving. Penalties vary by state, but can include juvenile detention time, suspended licenses, impounded vehicles and big fines.",3.6666666666666665,4.0,1.6666666666666667,3.333333333333333,4.0,3.0,3.6666666666666665," Valentine Joseph says three of her four brothers died when she was growing up with sickle cell disease .

How to Do It is Slate’s sex advice column. Have a question? Send it to Stoya and Rich here. It’s anonymous!

Dear How to Do It,

I am a straight woman in my late 20s dating a man of the same age. My boyfriend told me he was asexual when I met him. I am not, but that was never a problem; he is OK with hand stuff and receiving oral sex, and we have had a satisfying relationship for more than three years. Recently, we have begun having penetrative sex at his suggestion. Personally, I am thrilled. I had never hoped to change him or try to suggest penetrative sex, but I do really enjoy it and am happy that we can bring it into our relationship. I have been trying to have more conversations about it just to make sure he is comfortable with this shift, but he does not really want to have them after sex or in the daylight at all. He seems to be having an OK time with it (he enjoys himself during the act and continues to initiate it), but he does not want to talk with me explicitly about how he currently identifies. How can I best support him in what seems to be a transitional period regarding sex and sexual ID?

—Something-Sexual

Dear Something-Sexual,

This is not my wheelhouse, so I called in Cyndi Darnell, sex and relationship therapist and friend of the column, for some expert advice. Here’s what she had to say about what you can expect from your partner:

How your partner identifies is important and how he participates in sex may be influenced and determined by his identity too. Similarly, your sexual and emotional needs are important and require care and attention also. He may not want to discuss his identity with you which, while frustrating for you, is his private business. However, if he is having sexual interactions with you and you want to talk about that, he needs to recognize that having frank and honest discussions about sex and its effect on your relationship is an important part of any mature adult intimate relationship. Talking about sex—when you’re not in the middle of doing it—is crucial to keeping tabs on how it’s going. His identity is not a get-out-of-jail-free card to avoid having conversations he may find challenging. People of all orientations and identities are obliged to nourish their relationships by participating in communication and care. Discussing sex is a crucial part of having a rich erotic relationship whether you’re having intercourse or only giving each other oral and hand jobs. Whether he’s experiencing an erotic transition or morphing into demisexuality rather than strictly asexuality, it may be as bewildering to him as it is to you. To help you get a little clearer, I invite you to consider what exactly you’d like to know about his identity, especially given that he’s initiating sex, and, as you say, appears happy about it. Are you simply trying to connect with him, or is there more you would like to know to help you understand the relationship further? Perhaps if you guided him around your communication motivation, he may be a little more open to it. Or perhaps talking about sex squicks him out, in which case now is a great time for him to learn to practice stepping up and doing it differently.

To summarize, you’re going to have to talk about (some of) it.

Dear How to Do It,

Woman in her 40s here.

Do vibrators decrease sensitivity to pleasuring with fingering? I learned to masturbate in my mid-20s and initially just used my fingers and porn. I never had a vaginal orgasm, although I do very much enjoy vaginal intercourse. My first masturbation orgasm opened a whole new world for me. Then I discovered vibrators, and instead of 10 to 15 minutes for me to orgasm, it was two to five minutes for the most part—sometimes longer, but rarely more than 10 minutes.

I never orgasmed from fingering from a partner until my current spouse, and while it took a while, it still happened maybe every second or third time. I loved it. Then we had kids, and no one has the energy for loooong sex sessions anymore, so it was easier for me to just use the vibrator after (together) or on my own. Some years went by, and we now have a bit more time occasionally, and he’s put some real effort into masturbating me, but has not been able to get me to orgasm again. I’ve come close, but then I always get anxious about how long it’s taking, and whether he’s tired already, and I “lose” it.

One thing I’ve wondered about is whether my use of vibrators has “dulled” things, making me less sensitive? I can no longer finger myself to an orgasm anymore either, nor do I have the patience or energy, frankly, when a vibrator will do the job in two to three minutes. I do use a very strong vibrator and like it that way. My spouse is OK with me using it after to “finish up,” but I do miss orgasming from his fingering. Do I need to suck it up, stop using a vibrator, and learn how to masturbate with my own fingers again to regain it? Do vibrators make a difference to sensitivity and that is indeed the issue, or is that a myth?

Is it all in my head, and it’s my anxiety about me taking too long to orgasm with his fingering that is stopping me from reaching orgasm? Is it possible to orgasm from someone else’s fingering, when I can’t even do it for myself anymore? Your insights on this will be greatly appreciated.

—Can’t Put My Finger on It

Dear Can’t Put My Finger on It,

The body can absolutely become accustomed to a certain kind of stimulation. Yes, that includes vibrators. Take a break from the vibe for a few weeks and see what your sensory input is like after you’ve had some time off.

Another factor here is that sexuality shifts over the course of our lives. What you liked in your 30s and what you like in your 40s may be two different things. You might need different pressure or technique than you needed before you had kids.

You can experiment by yourself or with your husband. The goal here is to try all the things and find out what works now. Start with broad pressure (rest your palm on the pubic mound and apply gentle pressure to the vulva with your flat fingers). Move into strokes around the clitoris and clitoral hood. Work directly with the clitoral glans. Pay attention to the bottom of the labia and the crease between inner and outer labia. Follow what feels good. You’ve got this.

Dear How to Do It,

My husband and I are straight and have been poly for a couple years, and it’s working out really nicely for us. We’re fantastic, loving partners and parents together but aren’t sexually compatible, so I initiated the change to poly. We’re both stable, long-term-relationship kind of people. We both spend about the same amount of time with secondary partners, but he spreads his time among a few regular secondary partners and I prefer to have a single secondary partner. My secondary for the last year has been a man with a primary partner, and it’s been great. I don’t know his primary well, but my partner did a good job of balancing both. I felt cared for. We recently broke up, sadly but amicably, because he needed to focus more on his primary relationship.



While I’m not ready to date again just yet, it has me thinking about what’s next. If I could order up my perfect secondary, I’d like a single (divorced, widowed, whatever) man for whom I am the only one. I’m thinking someone who has a fulfilling independent life and/or busy enough schedule that a married woman he sees a couple nights a week fits. Someone with long-term potential who lived on his own but was maybe part of our family dynamic and who my kids saw as a family friend.



I’ve dated two single men before, and one wanted more of my time than I could give. The other one actually fit that ideal profile and it worked well for a while, but we broke up for unrelated reasons. I’m trying to decide if this is a realistic thing for me to seek. Are there men this might appeal to? I mean, I found one. Surely there are others? Or is it “un-poly” of me to want a secondary partner who sees only me, and I should be unpacking my reasons for wanting this? Am I really a monogamous person making do, and is that bad?

—Single Secondary

Dear Single Secondary,

I’d like us to take a minute to separate “poly” from individual needs and desires. Yes, there’s a poly community that does things in certain ways. Yes, there are a few books about poly relationships that seem to dictate how “poly” should be done. At the end of the day, though, different relationship structures should be about getting people’s needs met in ways that work for everyone involved.

So let go of any pressure you might be feeling to do poly “right.” As long as everyone involved is happy, I think everything is fine.

I do think you should unpack your reasons for wanting the arrangement you desire—for your own sake, and for that of your partners. The more you understand about what you want, the better you’ll be able to communicate that to your potential partners.

Remember this whole mono/poly thing is a spectrum. A forked spectrum. Complete monogamy is on one end, and the other end forks at ethical nonmonogamy into polyamory and relationship anarchy. The top fork is about structure and the bottom fork is about, well, not structure. You might be a 0.5 on the mono-poly scale. You might be a 1. Some people are in a relationship anarchy zone that requires the one word I promised my editor I wouldn’t use in this column: polyfuckery.

I do want to caution you that it’s unlikely you’ll find someone who wants to be a monogamous secondary for an extended period of time. Then again, the universe might surprise us both. Good luck out there.

Dear How to Do It,

My husband (of 13 years) says his preferred frequency is sex three times a week. I could go three months without thinking about sex. What do we do? If you’re going to say I should spend more time with my body by masturbating or using toys or porn or flirtatious texting—we have tried it all. Our sexual incompatibility remains the source of greatest tension in our relationship.

—Tale As Old As Time

Dear Tale As Old As Time,

Have you considered opening up the relationship? It isn’t necessarily going to be easy, but it would allow you to have sex on your own schedule while knowing your partner’s needs are getting met.

You might find Emily Nagoski’s Come As You Are useful, too. It talks a lot about different arousal styles and how partners can use that knowledge to help their lover’s engine get started.

Either way, remember that you love each other and communicate to the best of your ability.

—Stoya

More How to Do It

I’m dating a new man. When we became intimate, I was pleasantly surprised that he was very well-endowed (about 8 inches). The sex is solid and getting better, but I’ve noticed his erections are not particularly, well, erect—he’s definitely hard and penetration isn’t a problem, but he’s not rock-hard like many men I’ve been with in the past. I raise this question because it reminded me that another very well-endowed man I was with in the past also had this issue; he’d be hard, but he was never going to cut a diamond. Is this common? Is there just not enough blood to power the biggest guys?","Please enable Javascript to watch this video

5 Detective Comics #1018

By: Peter J. Tomasi, Scott Godlewski, David Baron, Rob Leigh, Rafael Sandoval, Jordi Tarragona, and John Kalisz

COMIXOLOGY

There’s a killer on the loose in Gotham City, but what else is new? Bruce Wayne’s home town has no shortage of madmen and monsters terrorizing its streets, but after a string of “festive” murders, The Dark Knight finds himself on the trail of a criminal who bases his crimes on Christmas tradition.

Writer Peter J. Tomasi and artist Scott Godlewski kick off a new story arc appropriately titled “Death of Winter,” in which the most wonderful time of the year turns deadly and the person behind the carnage has their eyes set Gotham’s favorite son.

4 Martian Manhunter #11

By: Steve Orlando, Riley Rossmo, Ivan Plascencia, and Deron Bennett

COMIXOLOGY

Despite their respective powers and fortitude, the duo of J’onn J’onzz and Diane Meade have the deck stacked against them in this penultimate issue of DC Comics’ wild, science fiction 12-issue maxi-series. The only thing standing between Char’rnn O’zzm, the charming red fellow with the winning smile, and the town of Midleton’s destruction is our titular green hero.

Martian Manhunter #11 is a reminder of why this series is so engaging. Its script is propulsive and sharp. And the artwork is kinetic and exaggerated to Tex Avery levels of insanity. This series has been so much fun for the past year, and we’re happy to see it moving toward the epic ending it deserves.

3 Hawkeye: Freefall #1

By: Matthew Rosenberg, Otto Schmidt, VC’s Joe Sabino, Kim Jacinto, and Tamra Bonvillain

COMIXOLOGY

There is a certain level of joy one gets from seeing the character of The Hood pop up in a comic book. That joy stems from the knowledge that you’re going to see a rather obnoxious villain, who everyone sells short too often, get pounded on by Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. Of course, when that doesn’t exactly happen, things get interesting.

Diving deep into the lore of Clint Barton, such as it is, Hawkeye: Freefall #1 is a fast funny story that echoes the iconic run by Matt Fraction and David Aja, but widens its net for weird and mystic elements. Writer Matthew Rosenberg and artist Otto Schmidt are clearly having a blast here and it’s hard to imagine anyone who picks this book up wouldn’t as well.

2 Star Wars #1

By: Charles Soule, Jesus Saiz, Arif Prianto, VC’s Clayton Cowles, R.B. Silva, and GURU-eFX

COMIXOLOGY

Taking place immediately after the events of The Empire Strikes Back, Star Wars #1 follows Luke, Leia, Lando, and Chewie after taking nearly escaping with their lives and losing Han Solo… of course, you already knew all of that. What you may not know is that once free from the Empire-controlled Cloud City, more dangers await.

With a strong script filled with wonderful characterizations of iconic Star Wars heroes, gorgeous art, and all new villain, this debut issue is a great way to kick the New Year for pop culture’s most celebrated and debated space opera.

1 X-Men #4

By: Jonathan Hickman, Leinil Francis Yu, Gerry Alanguilan, Sunny Gho, VC’s Clayton Cowles, and Tom Muller

COMIXOLOGY

Jonathan Hickman and Leinil Francis Yu’s flagship title in the “Dawn of X” fleet speeds ahead in X-Men #4. The leaders of Krakoa attend the World Economic Forum, which, on the surface, sounds like yawner of a plot. Thankfully, where the X-Men go, trouble tends to follow.

Brokering peace is no easy task, especially when one nation in that discussion is populated with characters who could potentially annihilate an entire country with their abilities. Hickman and Yu explore the idea of a country birthed in a contentious position, wherein their mere existence frightens other world leaders. Complex, well-written, and wonderfully illustrated X-Men #4 is another winner for the new state of Marvel’s mutant roster.

184,185,Springfield students of all ages give back to community this holiday season,"Opinion | For Some Jews, a Menorah and a Christmas Tree","



LAKEMORE We all know Santa has a very kind and giving soul. Like the United States Postal Service, he never fails to deliver gifts whether it is through the bitter cold, extreme heat, snow, ice, rain, hail ... you get the point.

Even at his age, 1,749 years old, he never misses his big night of traveling around the world to deliver brightly wrapped packages and fill stockings with items that fulfill the wishes of little girls and boys and some of us older kids too.

Students and staff members of the Springfield Local School District have done Santa in reverse for many years by giving to others.

Students are taught from their youngest school years the “7 Healthy Habits” and “Leader in Me” programs which help to develop a kind, cooperate personality in the young students.

Beyond the lessons they learn through the programs, they see their parents and school staff members model the qualities of giving and kindness to others.

The children of the schools have that giving spirit from kindergarten through high school. During this holiday season, they participated in a variety of giving projects.

At Young Elementary School, it begins early with Socktober. For the month of October, students and staff bring in socks to donate to the homeless. This year, they collected 1,042 pairs of socks. Socks are something homeless shelters desperately need.

Recently, all Springfield Schools participated in a district wide food drive to help fill the need in the community. Canned goods and non-perishable food items were collected at each school and members of the National Honor Society from the high school traveled from school to school to collect the items and took them to the Springfield Cares organization where they helped to sort and box the items.

More than 7,000 food items were given by Springfield students and staff members and they helped feed Christmas dinners to those in need in the Springfield and Lakemore communities.

The schools are Young and Spring Hill Elementary Schools, Schrop Intermediate and the Springfield Junior/Senior High School.

Clothing items were also collected by some of the schools. Young Elementary School, through its parent teacher organization, held a clothing and toy drive for Springfield Cares to include in its Christmas giving program.

At Schrop Intermediate School, students did a variety of collections to help in a variety of ways. Students took time during their lunch to make stockings and gifts. Some were going to parents, some to other children or those who might need one to hang by the fireplace. The students were so happy to speak about their gifts – Isola Whitacre and Jessie Bakeer made pillows, Sunni Nangle made a cup koozie and loves to make scrunchies, Ty Smith made stockings and Daysjariah Williams had been sewing a stocking to surprise someone special.

Also at Schrop, the students in Holly Reed’s class brought in new toys and games for the Toys for Tots program. The sixth graders collected more than 50 items for donation. The students on the teaching team of Droppleman, Mick and Tolson collected pajamas for the Scholastic News pajama drive for children. Students on the team of Zehner, Denczak and Johnston collected hats, gloves and scarves for Springfield Cares.

Teacher Kristine DiLauro's class made blankets and donated them to Harvest Home (homeless shelter). The team of students for teachers Burns, Brasiel, Yacobucci, Ferguson and Chumita collected tie dye supplies for summer camp at Camp Quality, a camp for students with cancer. The students on the team of Justice, Villers and Bogunovich collected $5 gift cards to give to police and firefighters in Springfield to use for a snack/drink while they are protecting our community. The students on the team of Wagner, Rossiter and Wander collected deodorant, soap, shampoo, combs and brushes for Springfield Cares and the students on the team of Williams, Freeze and Francis shopped for gifts for Springfield Cares.

Giving and sharing is a big part of who the Springfield Local Schools and Springfield and Lakemore communities are. That caring and giving spirit is seen in many ways in the community from Shop With A Cop to Share A Christmas and other programs that the kind and selfless people of Springfield, Lakemore and the schools demonstrate throughout their daily lives.","To the Editor:

Re “My Jewish Sons Have a Christmas Tree, and I Need to Deal,” by Hanna Ingber (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Dec. 24):

As a Jewish child growing up in a predominantly Christian community, I always felt a bit deprived at Christmastime. As I entered adulthood and had a home of my own, I opted to have a Christmas tree. After marrying a Jewish man and having children, I had to make a decision about the oft-predicted “confusion” they might experience.

We continued to have a Christmas tree (and the belief in Santa) and used it as the “teachable moment” I think it can and should be. I explained to my children the meaning of Christmas for our Christian friends and their need to be respectful of its holy significance. Then I explained that Christmas is also a season with a spirit of family, friends, giving and sharing. As long as we respected the difference between spiritual symbols and secular symbols, there was no reason we could not share in the joy of this season.

From my understanding, there is nothing religious about a Christmas tree, Santa Claus, family gatherings, supporting charities and exchanging gifts. I had this conversation regularly with my children throughout their childhood and teenage years.

Bringing our story up to the present, my children, both in their mid-20s, have strong, unconflicted Jewish identities. In fact, they are both young professionals working within the Jewish community, my son as a temple youth director and my daughter in Jewish philanthropy. I think this is the optimal win-win outcome.",3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,1.0,3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,2.0, Springfield Local School District students and staff members have done Santa in reverse for many years by giving to others .

186,187,"Detroit Lions sign 3 more players to futures contracts, including former Michigan State TE",Detroit Lions 7-round 2020 NFL mock draft: Who to take at No. 3?,"ALLEN PARK -- The Detroit Lions announced two tight ends and a center as additional reserve/future signings since the season ended.

Detroit added 11 players to futures deals to start the week, and then signed center Russell Bodine, and tight ends Paul Butler and Matt Sokol on Tuesday. If Sokol’s name sounds familiar, that’s because he played tight end at Michigan State University for four seasons.

The 6-foot-6 tight end went undrafted and has yet to make his NFL debut, but bounced around on the Chargers and Jaguars’ practice squads this season. He caught 31 passes for 348 yards and two touchdowns while in East Lansing.

Bodine has some experience under his belt as a former fourth-round pick of the Cincinnati Bengals back in 2014. The center started all 16 games for the first four seasons of his career for Cincinnati, but was limited to 10 in Buffalo in 2018 and did not appear in one this year. He was last seen with the New England Patriots after the team traded a sixth-round pick for his services, but he was cut shortly after in September.

Pro Football Focus graded Bodine at 61.6 overall, 74.6 in pass protection and 56.0 on the ground in 2018 while with the Bills. His 588 snaps played that year represented a career low.

Related: Lions sign 11 players to futures contract, including long snapper

As for Butler, the 6-foot-6 tight end has spent some time with Oakland’s practice squad but has not appeared in a regular-season game. He’s played in eight preseason contests for the Raiders over the past two seasons, catching eight passes for 83 yards.

These three join the list of 11 announced on Monday, which was mainly Detroit’s practice squad outside of quarterback Joe Callahan. The list included receivers Victor Bolden, Jonathan Duhart, Tom Kennedy, and safety A.J. Howard, defensive tackle Olive Sagapolu, linebacker Christian Sam and guard Casey Tucker.

The Lions signed punters Jack Fox and Matt Wile as Sam Martin is eligible to test free agency come March. Detroit also added former North Dakota State long snapper James Fisher to a futures deal.

Don Muhlbach has started all 160 games at long snapper for the Lions in the last decade and has played 244 games for the franchise. He’s 56th all-time on the NFL’s games played list and remains a more than capable snapper at this stage of his career.","Rebuilding the Detroit Lions with a seven-round 2020 NFL mock draft.

Early in the season, the Detroit Lions looked like a legitimate playoff contender in the NFC. They started 2-0-1 and followed that with close losses to the Chiefs and Packers, both of which were games that could have gone either way. Despite the losses, there was hope that by showing they can play with two of NFL’s best teams that they could certainly compete for a playoff spot.

But with Matthew Stafford missing the whole second half of the season, they lost their last nine games finishing 3-12-1 and have the third overall selection in the draft. Looking at their roster it is pretty clear to me that the Detroit Lions must use the draft to rebuild their defense.

The offense has a pretty solid offensive line, a young, talented running back in Kerryon Johnson, last year’s first-round tight end T.J. Hockenson, and one of the best receivers in the league, Kenny Golladay.

In the seven games this season with Stafford under center, Detroit averaged 25.5 points per game, which would of finished top 10 in the NFL. If he can stay healthy, this can certainly be a good offense for the foreseeable future.

The defense meanwhile has holes all over the place. They have massive needs at cornerback, linebacker and on the interior of the defensive line. Finding players at these positions without reaching will be the key for the Detroit Lions in the draft.

The Lions do not have any extra picks, they just have their own picks for the first through sixth rounds. They did trade their seventh-round pick to the 49ers for Eli Harold.

So, without further ado, here is a projection of what the Detroit Lions will do with their six picks in April’s draft.",1.0,2.6666666666666665,3.0,3.333333333333333,3.333333333333333,2.333333333333333,2.0, Detroit Lions sign two tight ends and a center as reserve/future signings since the season ended .

Celebrating New Years Eve on a cruise is exactly why we booked this cruise, and the day is finally here.

Before we get to the New Years celebrations, we did have a great sea day lined up to enjoy.

We kicked off our morning with a private ice skating session. As part of our group cruise activities, we rented out Studio B so that everyone in the group could enjoy a private free skate session.

I was happy to say I managed to not fall and/or embarrass myself during the skating session.

After ice skating, some of us headed to the Schooner Bar for morning trivia. I really enjoy trivia on a cruise ship, and it was a good set of questions. While my team did not win, another team made of up group cruisers did win.

Next up was the suite concierge invitation for a reception in celebration of all suite guests. It was held in Giovanni's Table, where light snacks and beverages were served and the ship's officers came by to say hello.

For lunch, we decided to eat in the main dining room. As per usual on a sea day, there is a fixed menu available, as well as a salad bar option.

In the afternoon, our next group cruise event was scheduled, which was the pub crawl. A pub crawl is basically where we enjoy a drink or two at a few bars on the ship in quick succession.

We managed to visit the Bull & Bear Pub, R-Bar, Boleros and the Windjammer Bar.

I feel that pub crawls are more about the social aspect of getting to know people who are cruising with us, and enjoying each other's company.

As afternoon turned to evening, it was time to get ready for the New Years Eve festivities.

We enjoyed dinner in the main dining room, which had plenty of New Years Eve hats, horns and noise makers.

Essentially, the ship is a giant party, and there are different venues around the ship offering various entertainment.

The Royal Promenade is at the heart of everything you can do, but it is also sure to be jam-packed with guests. Royal Caribbean sold private tables to enjoy along the Promenade, but you could stand around as well.

There was live music at various bars and lounges around the ship.

While the Promenade had a lot going on, it was bit too crowded (and hot) for my taste, so most of us decided to ring in the new year from the On Air Club, which had plenty of seating and a full bar as well.

It was a really cool feeling to countdown the final seconds of 2019 with friends, and we enjoyed some great after-party music around the ship following the new year.

Happy New Year everyone!","The New Testament Church of God in Old Harbour, St Catherine was packed to capacity Tuesday with worshippers who rang in the new year with the traditional watchnight service.

A major highlight of the night was the baptism of 10 persons - eight females and two males - who responded to a call by Bishop Hugh Dixon to start the new year right by giving their lives to Christ.

188,189,,,"Some say the deer that seem to have settled into an Alberta town are aggressive and need action after two reports five years ago dropped the issue in town council's lap.

A task force is now looking at the problem with headcounts, public input and recommendations due later in the year.

But some residents are wondering if they are the same deer that also stop and look both ways before using a crosswalk to cross the street.

""I have never seen deer anywhere else who look both ways before they cross the street and use crosswalks. It's a little creepy but really cool,"" Whitney Pohl told CBC News.

Whitney Pohl said she's seen deer in Okotoks looking both ways before crossing the street while using a crosswalk. (Dave Gilson/CBC)

She's lived in Okotoks — about 20 kilometres from the southern outskirts of Calgary — for 18 years.

""I quite like them. It is great seeing them around town. They seem to have adapted really well to urbanization,"" she said.

""I know some people have had issues with their dog but they check my dog and as soon as they see it's on a leash, they don't care, they just keep doing their thing.""

Courtney Stephenson says where she lives, the deer use crosswalks. (Dave Gilson/CBC)

Another Okotoks resident — who grew up in neighbouring Turner Valley — volunteered her observation of the safety-focused ungulate without being prompted.

""Where I live, they cross at the crosswalk, so at least they are being safe. They do cross at the crosswalk, it's really funny,"" Courtney Stephenson said with a laugh.

A task force is now looking at the problem with head counts, public input and recommendations due later in the year. (Dave Gilson/CBC)

In spring of 2015, the town received two complaints about aggressive deer, said parks manager Christa Michailuck, using the province's definition of aggression as chasing or kicking at people or pets.

""There have been no reports of anyone getting injured,"" Michailuck said, ""But a couple of reports of pets getting injured.""

That pair of complaints had 100 volunteers counting 66 doe in September of that year, the first of several headcounts.

In 2018 two separate surveys found 64 and 38, respectively, in the town of roughly 30,000 residents.

Christa Michailuck is parks manager at the southern Alberta town of Okotoks. (Dave Gilson/CBC)

That same year, those two complaints had tripled to about six, Michailuck said, with yard and garden damage a common theme.

The town posts signs in areas where complaints are received and pushes out messages on social media.

Michailuck says counts are about establishing baseline data.

""So, are we really seeing an increase in population or are we seeing the same cohort of individuals, or are their behaviours changing as they get more accustomed to an urban setting?""

Grant Pryznyk is chair of the town’s urban deer task force. The force will study the problem and offer ideas to council in November. (Dave Gilson/CBC)

Grant Pryznyk, the chair of the town's urban deer task force, says this could be the first of its kind in the province, although Pincher Creek is also looking at the problem.

""The deer were getting into their gardens, eating flowers and vegetables. There were instances of aggressive deer around people who were walking, especially with dogs,"" Pryznyk said.

There are things residents can do, he said, including adding deer-repelling plants to gardens, building higher fences and avoiding feeding them.

""The residents have a major role to play in this. The town can't do it all by themselves,"" Pryznyk said.

Jennifer Tomlin says she likes the deer. (Dave Gilson/CBC)

Jennifer Tomlin — who has lived in the area since 1984 — agrees with personal responsibility.

""I think it's pleasant because I like seeing wildlife. I don't want to see humans take over anymore, quite honestly. I would like to see us live compatibly with the wildlife,"" Tomlin said.

""I wouldn't like to see them killing them. I really wouldn't.""

In 2015, volunteers counted 66 deer. Then two surveys in 2018 revealed 64 and 38 respectively. Okotoks has a population of roughly 30,000. (Dave Gilson/CBC)

The task force reports back to council in November with ideas.

But some say today, we already have the answers.

""I am not sure what the end result is supposed to be,"" Pohl said.

""They don't bother me,"" adds Stephenson, ""There are quite a few. You see them probably every day almost. We live in an area that has lots of parks and rivers, so it is to be expected.""","The man killed in a Monday shooting in the northeast Calgary neighbourhood of Rundle has been identified.

Warning

(Image by jeremiah.andrick) Details DMCA



The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental body combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system. Pakistan was placed on FATF's grey list of jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies in June 2018, alongside Syria and Yemen, one step away from getting blacklisted.

Pakistan is not out of the woods with FATF's threat of blacklisting. The Paris-based global watchdog has just shot out a list 150 questions to the Pakistan government on measures taken to curb the twin menaces of money-laundering and terrorist financing plaguing the land of the pure. It has sought details of legal measures, including copies of First Information Reports (FIRs) registered with police against individuals and action taken to regulate the functioning of religious seminaries.

The Imran Khan government cannot hope to muster parliamentary and political support from the opposition parties to address all these questions to FATF's satisfaction. The looming threat of blacklisting has implications for capital inflows to the country, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned after its team held discussions in Islamabad last week.

""A potential blacklisting by FATF could result in a freeze of capital flows and lower investment to Pakistan"", stated the IMF staff-level report released two days before Christmas. The expected slow progress in refinancing, reprofiling of loans from major bilateral creditors, and increasing headwinds from a weaker global economic environment are bound to compound miseries for the Imran Khan government.

IMF bailed out the cash-strapped Pakistan economy a couple of months ago after Pakistan found no manna forthcoming from Saudi and Chinese largesse. It is a matter of concern and a reality check that the quality of fiscal adjustments was not high in the first quarter (July-September). The reintroduction of debt servicing surcharge in power bills on account of circular debt-related fresh borrowings, as also the proposed hike in power tariffs from January, are welcome but not sufficient to put the economy back on track. IMF also has reasons to be unhappy with the budgetary rejig that resulted in the blocking Rs40 billion worth of payments to the Benazir Income Support Fund beneficiaries, and the severe curtailment of health and education spending by Rs92 billion.

As The News International, a Karachi daily, reported on 24 December, Pakistan has to demonstrate a substantial level of financial effectiveness to the IMF by end-March 2020, consistent with the FATF action plan. Resistance to reform from vested interest groups will undermine IMF's fiscal consolidation strategy and place the country's debt sustainability at risk.

Prime Minister Imran Khan and his economic wizards have been selling dreams of a turnaround in the economy and robust growth rates. But the IMF has not bought into any of these plans. In fact, in its latest assessment, the lender of last resort has kept Pakistan's growth rate target unchanged at 2.4% for the current fiscal year. Anecdotal evidence suggests unemployment is rising and there is considerable underemployment in the informal sector as well. According to IMF, ""Growth is therefore projected to strengthen to around 3% in the next fiscal year"", subject to policies taking hold and business and investment confidence strengthening.

Undoubtedly, Pakistan's Achilles heel is its debt, which continues to rise. ""The general government debt, including guarantees and IMF borrowing, rose to 88% of GDP by end of last fiscal year, which was higher by 8.7% of the GDP against the IMF's own estimates."" For this fiscal year, too, the IMF has revised its public debt and liabilities projections higher to 84.7% of GDP or Rs37.6 trillion. The power sector's total debt alone as of end-September 2019 increased to Rs1.69 trillion.

IMF had earlier projected public debt and liabilities at Rs35.7 trillion or 80.5% of the GDP. It has now increased the estimates by 4.2% of the GDP or Rs1.9 trillion. The swelling debt is clearly due to fiscal slippages, exchange rate depreciation and the government's decision to increase cash deposits considerably to provide a financing cushion against potentially unfavourable market conditions.

There may be truth in this assessment but the significant increase in public debt raises a big question mark on the working of the IMF in making the initial estimates after the close of the last fiscal year. It also brings upfront what the IMF staff report grudgingly concedes as higher than usual risks in Pakistan's capacity to repay its obligations to the global lender in a timely manner.

On the positive side, debt remains sustainable over the medium-term, ""given the broadly unchanged macro-economic framework, the policies to date, and the authorities' policy commitments ahead."" However, on the flip side, debt sustainability faces higher risks arising from ""fiscal under-performance in FY 2019, a higher debt out-turn, and higher financing needs"". There are also what the IMF terms as ""elevated risks"" to Pakistan's repayment capacity on account of low reserves, higher gross financing needs and delayed adoption of adjustment policies.

Viewed against this backdrop, it is difficult to accept Pakistan's claims as articulated by Central Bank Governor, Reza Baqir. On 15 December, he stated that both FATF and IMF have expressed ""satisfaction over the measures so far taken"" for streamlining the anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regimes. Pakistan's FATF mess is a self-inflicted wound.

As the Peshawar daily, The Frontier Post, editorial noted on 23 December 2019, both the PML-N and the PPP had shown no seriousness in coming to grips with the FATF issues when they were in the driver's seat. Had the two mainstream political parties passed and enforce the required legislations, Pakistan would not have been placed on the grey list in 2008 and from 2012-2015. Their failure, coupled with their tall claims that Pakistan has very strong anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regimes, resulted in Pakistan returning to the grey list in June 2018.

The global watchdog is now pressing the PTI government to get its act together in letter and spirit in its own near-term interests. What this means in essence is a reform of Pakistan's criminal justice system to choke the sources of finance for banned outfits which currently enjoy the status of non-state actors.

190,191,Terror Epidemic: African-American Suspect Threatens To ‘Bomb All The Jews In Jersey City’,5 People Injured In Stabbing Attack In NY Rabbi's Home During Hanukkah Celebration,"This is the real developing terror threat.

(Big League Politics) – An African-American suspect from Jersey City has been arrested after allegedly making threats to bomb all of Jewish people in the area.

Darryl Jacobs, 47, is accused of making the threat on Dec. 13, shortly after a Kosher store was attacked by black supremacists. He allegedly made the threat while on the phone with a welfare worker in the county, and was arrested three days after reportedly making the comment.



Above: Darryl Jacobs

According to the criminal complaint filed against Jacobs, law enforcement did not seize any explosives but did take two cell phones. The court document claims that Jacobs said he “was going to come down and bomb all the Jews in Jersey City” to the welfare employee, who was not acquainted with the alleged terrorist.

Authorities claim Jacobs was likely intoxicated while he made the comment. He is facing a third-degree charge of making a terrorist threat.

Jacobs is apart of a wave of apparent black supremacist terrorism that is causing untold damage to the Jewish community. In addition to the Dec. 10 terrorist attack at the JC Kosher Supermarket that resulted in six deaths, there was another terrorist event that caused significant damage this past weekend.

Five Jewish individuals were stabbed at a Hanukkah celebration in a Rabbi’s home on Sunday, in what is being called an act of domestic terrorism with an African-American suspect allegedly committing the heinous act:

An attacker stabbed five people Saturday evening at the home of an ultra-Orthodox rabbi during a Hanukkah celebration in Monsey, New York, in what Governor Andrew Cuomo said would be prosecuted as a case of domestic terrorism. The suspect fled the scene, but New York City Police Department arrested him after locating his vehicle, confirmed Ramapo Police Chief Brad Weidel. He faces five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary, Weidel said. Police have identified him as Grafton E. Thomas, 37, of Greenwood Lake, New York. Thomas had blood all over his clothing and smelled of bleach, according to prosecutors. He was arraigned Sunday morning and pleaded not guilty. Bail was set at $5 million. Weidel also said the five victims were taken to hospital for treatment. One victim is reportedly in critical condition, said Evan Bernstein, the Anti-Defamation’s New York/New Jersey regional director. The suspect’s criminal history includes an arrest for assaulting a police horse, according to an official briefed on the investigation. A lawyer representing Thomas at the arraignment said he had no convictions… On Sunday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called the stabbing an act of domestic terrorism fueled by intolerance. He said the attack was evidence of an “American cancer in the body politic.” One person was very seriously wounded, the governor told reporters, and remained in critical condition. The rabbi’s son was also injured, Cuomo said. His status and that of the other victims was not clear.

While liberals obsess on the largely non-existent threat of white supremacy, real terror and crime threats put the Jewish community and other vulnerable groups at serious risk.

bigleaguepolitics.com/terror-epidemic-african-american-suspect-threatens-to-bomb-all-the-jews-in-jersey-city/","Five people were injured Saturday night when a man armed with appeared to be a machete burst into a rabbi’s home in a New York City suburb and began slashing at a group attending a Hanukkah celebration, CBS News reported.

The man, wearing a scarf over his face, reportedly chased victims as they ran from the scene in Monsey in Rockland County north of Manhattan, then fled in a car. He was captured by New York City police around midnight in the 32nd Precinct in Harlem, said Ramapo Police Chief Bill Weidel.

Five victims were rushed to local hospitals; two of them were in critical condition, according to the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council. One victim was reportedly stabbed at least six times.

The motive for the attack was still unknown late Saturday. But there were at least six suspected anti-Semitic attacks in New York City in the week prior. Police patrols were being boosted in three Brooklyn neighborhoods in response.

The Counterterrorism unit of the New York City Police Department was monitoring the situation in Monsey, a community with a large population of ultra-Orthodox Jews. Just last month a teacher and father of four in Monsey was critically injured when he was stabbed on his way to synagogue.

The attack Saturday occurred in the home of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg, who heads Congregation Netzach Yisroel next door to his house, according to the Rockland/Westchester Journal.

The Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council said early Sunday that people had continued their celebrations in the synagogue located next to Rabbi Rottenberg’s home following Saturday’s stabbing attack.

Footage of the gathering shared on Twitter shows congregants clapping and singing. ”‘The grace of God did not end and his mercy did not leave us,’ is a rough translation of the lyrics,” the council said of the clip.

191,192,There is no such thing as 'authentic' food. Ignore the purists | Mai Tran,Roslyn Dee: 'Let us share Gatsby's gift of hope in the new twenties',"With food politics, it is tempting to want to categorize dishes as your own, especially as a second- or third-generation Asian American. Growing up in southern California, 20 minutes from Orange county’s famous Little Saigon district, I was raised on phở restaurants with linoleum floors, Formica tables and servers who openly chided my weak accent. You can’t get more Vietnamese than that, and I took pride in it.

Later, as a college student in New York, I started work at a phở restaurant in Greenwich Village. I applied to the job, where I still work today, in part because I wanted to be a starving artist without actually starving, but also because I thought it would connect me to a Vietnamese community that was otherwise difficult to find in New York, where there is only a small Vietnamese population.

On my first day of work, I clocked in to discover that almost all the workers were Chinese or Latinx. There was not much of an ethnic connection, but I stayed anyway and was trained by the two owners, a pair of half-Vietnamese, half-Chinese men who had gentrified the menu for the Greenwich locals and college students. Fish sauce was generously renamed “Vietnamese chili,” and pig’s feet became “spicy pork knuckles”.

The owners were meticulous about decor, and invested in photogenic placemats, a stoop covered in florals and palm leaves, and a bar framed with painted army helmets and a neon “noodle” sign. “Introduce yourself to customers and check up on your tables,” they told me. “This isn’t Chinatown.”

I’ve served thousands of people since my first day, and have read every Yelp and Google review. Because of our English menu and appeal to customers who eat with their eyes, our lowest ratings often describe us as “trendy,” “white-washed” and “inauthentic”. Vietnamese customers, especially out-of-towners from areas with large populations of Vietnamese, such as San Jose or Houston, delight in asking if our owners are Chinese (we are trained to say no), ordering in Vietnamese to Cantonese servers, and remarking loudly, “Only two basil leaves?” “The beef is already cooked?” “We should open our own Vietnamese restaurant.”

Our head cook is half-Vietnamese, and we often tell customers about how he grew up in Saigon as the first line of defense when people say we aren’t Vietnamese enough. As the only full Vietnamese, I’ll be sent to Vietnamese customers to drop a few xin chàos and cám ơn anhs, even though we shouldn’t have anything to prove. French, Italian and other European restaurants are rarely held to the same standards of authenticity, so why do minority cultures, and particularly Asians, cling to traditional food so tightly?

The 20th century saw a wave of Asian immigrants who opened restaurants as a means of survival, a ready money source even if you couldn’t speak English. In recent years, Asian Americans have been entering the restaurant business or innovating their parents’ stores because of culinary ambitions, or to uphold a family history, rather than because it is their only option. Like their parents or grandparents, they are businesspeople; although passionate about their culture’s heritage, they are less interested in one singular way to cook. Yet their biggest critics are often other Asian Americans, who want food they can have authority over, claim as their own and use to bolster their identity credibility – even though authenticity is difficult to pin down and impossible to quantify.

It’s fine and admirable to open a restaurant with altruistic goals for its impact on community and culture. But many restaurants are still mainly a means to feed one’s family and the employees on payroll. Yes, our restaurant caters to American tastes and is designed around American ideas of Vietnam, but we’re also the most frequented phở joint in the area, and we’re helping introduce more people to Vietnamese food as well as pay our bills.

When 10lb-bowls of phở and phở burritos went viral, I was a bit pained to see a Vietnamese staple turned into what I deemed a business gimmick, and mixed with a different cuisine at that. But recipes aren’t stagnant, and neither is culture. Vestiges of French colonization are abundant in Vietnamese food, from Café du Monde coffee to bành mì baguettes, but these are now considered inherently Vietnamese, even as we distance ourselves from an imperialist past.

I’m no less Vietnamese because I’ll enjoy an “inauthentic” vegan phở, or a bành mì made by a Senegalese cook. There is no such thing as authentic food. Eat what you want, and enjoy it. There are more important hills to die on.","For this is a book that, for decades now, I always re-read every summer, as I did, once again this year, when I was in Greece. It's my personal literary obsession.

How much of an obsession? Well, I have 26 different editions of F Scott Fitzgerald's third novel residing side by side on my bookshelves. Among that number are two different Italian editions, plus one in French, one in Greek and another in Chinese, all of those 'foreign language' editions purchased when I found myself in the countries in question.

So yes, it's that much of an obsession.

But it was its relevance in this particular week of the year which prompted me to reach for the book again earlier this week.

For, as we head into 2020 with a whole new twenties decade lying ahead of us, is there any novel that better captures the spirit of that same decade, exactly a century ago, than 'The Great Gatsby'?

It's a snapshot of a society on the skite. Of the boom before the bust. It's a picture of greed and glamour. And of a generation in thrall to the false god of filthy lucre, living only for the moment and for themselves. ""Careless people,"" as Nick Carraway, the book's narrator, describes his cousin, Daisy, and her oaf of a husband, the loud, rich, bacchanalian Tom Buchanan.

We've been there too, of course. Back in the noughties, when we had our own 'The Great Gatsby' years right here in Ireland.

Just ponder this scene for a moment… ""The cars are parked five deep in the drive, and the bar is in full swing. Floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, with introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.""

Where are we? At an indulgent hooley on a hot summer's night at a garden party in Dublin 4? At a bash in the west to mark a spectacular fleecing in a property deal? Or at a pre-wedding party, perhaps, before the bride and groom to be jet off to tie the knot on the Amalfi coast or some other such ritzy destination, in the company of dozens of their 'best friends'?

No. None of those. Welcome, rather, in the scene depicted above, to New York in the summer of 1922. Welcome, indeed, in the words of F Scott Fitzgerald, to Long Island Sound and to the home of Jay Gatsby.

And if ever there was a lesson to be learned about the emptiness that results from desiring money for money's sake, then that lesson is writ large in the story of Gatsby himself.

What makes 'The Great Gatsby' 'great' for me, however - apart from the beautiful writing and its spot-on exploration of the destructiveness of excess and the fugitive nature of joy - is that while Jay Gatsby is essentially a fraud, he is, nonetheless, a fraud who genuinely believes in loyalty and love.

And also in something else of great value - hope. Right to the end he retains it, what Fitzgerald describes as Gatsby's ""extraordinary gift for hope"".

And what better a gift than that? For hope, as described by no less than Aristotle, is ""a waking dream"".

So as we head this week into our own not-so-roaring twenties, at a time when, despite the so-called 'lift' in our economy, so many problems still loom large for so many people, let's dare then, like Jay Gatsby, to hope. And to dream. For better times for all.

Havana, Dec 31 (Prensa Latina) Roberto Leon Richards, president of the Cuban Olympic Committee, and Osvaldo Vento, president of the National Sports Institute (INDER), congratulated the Cuban athletes, who are focusing their work on the Tokyo-2020 Olympics, for the new year.

On his Twitter account, Richards congratulated the athletes, coaches and the Cuban sports movement, to whom he sent a big hug, convinced that the Olympic event in Tokyo, Japan, will be another scenario of victories for them.



For his part, the INDER president recalled a statement by the historic leader of the Revolution, Fidel Castro, on the occasion of the 61st anniversary of that heoric deed.



'Let's remember Fidel as a permanent motivation for the commitments to come. He insisted that sports encourage the people, entertain the people, excite the people and make the people happy. Congratulations,' Vento twitted.



To date, Cuba has 26 qualified athletes for the Tokyo-2020 Olympic Games in boating (4), cycling (1), artistic gymnastics (2), wrestling (2), modern pentathlon (2), shooting (5) and track and field (10).



According to the Cuban Sports Institute, the number of athletes for the Olympic Games must exceed 100 and Cuban athletes are expected to attend qualifying events from January 5 and May 24, 2020.



jg/iff/jcm/rws","New Years-fresh starts, clean slates and new resolutions. Every first of January, people set New Year’s Resolutions in the hopes of improving themselves or their lives; but how best to make them stick?

The following are a few tips to help with keeping what we resolve to do-or not do in the new year, according to experts:

1. Set intentions. An intention is a guiding principle for how you want to be, live, show up in the world and is the starting point to every goal.

2. Ask yourself why the intention or goal you set matters to you-and if it is realistic. Expectations that are too high can cause you to be too overwhelmed to start or maintain your goals.

3. Talk to people about your resolutions. This creates a support system as well as can hold you accountable.

4. Make a list of plans. Big goals can seem daunting, break your plan up into little things you can do each day to help achieve your ultimate goal.

5. Take the first step. Don’t procrastinate. You don’t need to wait until everything is just right. Get started now and make adjustments as you go along.

6. Ditch deprivation. Try not to approach your New Year’s resolutions from a place of deprivation, restriction or punishment.

7. Try not to focus on the end result. When you commit to the process of the goal, rather than the result, it’s easier to make it an enjoyable experience.

8. Take breaks. A goal should not consume your every thought and life, after all, is meant to be lived.

9. Plan for success. Instead of thinking about failing and what could go wrong, think of succeeding; put those positive thoughts out to the world. Worrying about failure is pointless and destructive.

10. Reward yourself.

A day after the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad was stormed by pro-Iranian demonstrators, the White House needs to decide how to respond to the attack...","As the new civil year begins, an isolated event in northern Iraq threatens to snowball into an avalanche that will put America’s entire Middle East strategy to the test. The death of an American citizen in a rocket attack on an Iraqi base by an Iran-backed Shi’ite militia this weekend led to a large-scale retaliatory U.S. airstrike in which at least 25 militiamen were killed in Iraq and Syria.

On Tuesday, the Iranians and their allies responded with a violent demonstration staged by militia members outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, culminating with protesters breaking into the secured compound and American diplomats hastily evacuated from it.

The Iranian action caught U.S. President Donald Trump at a difficult moment. The next presidential election is less than a year away. Facing an unexciting array of Democratic candidates, Trump’s situation appears rather reasonable, especially if the economy continues on the relatively positive path he inherited from his predecessor, Barack Obama.

But the public and humiliating attack on an American symbol in the Middle East doesn’t look good. And if U.S. countermeasures lead to casualties, that would look even worse.

Trump, as has been said many times, has for years opposed military adventures in faraway countries in which he sees, at most, a limited American interest. In contrast, he seems to be infatuated with the policy of applying maximum pressure on Iran, under which Washington has gradually intensified its sanctions on the country. Even now, the administration is considering additional sanctions.

The damage these sanctions have caused Iran’s economy is indeed great, but so far, they haven’t had much diplomatic impact. Tehran hasn’t agreed to make the terms of its nuclear deal with world powers (from which America withdrew in May 2018) more stringent, and so far, it has even rejected the idea of a summit between the two countries’ leaders.

Since May, the main result of the sanctions was Iran’s decision to respond with assaults on oil facilities and tankers belonging to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and this weekend, also with an attack on a military base where Americans were stationed.

The death of an American national obligated Trump to respond, since Iran and its proxies had blatantly crossed a red line drawn by the president himself, along with other senior administration officials. But the mob storming the embassy in Baghdad caught him off guard. Trump’s tweets in recent days have been devoted to his usual spats with the Democrats and criticism of the media, yet once again, he had no choice but to respond.

To those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don’t want to be dominated and controlled by Iran, this is your time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2019

On Tuesday the president explicitly held Iran responsible for both the rocket fire and the storming of the embassy. He once again threatened a painful response and, in a tweet, urged the “many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom” to liberate themselves from Iranian influence.

In the background hovers America’s unforgotten national trauma from the 1979 hostage crisis at its embassy in Tehran. In 2012, the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya was attacked, an incident that Republicans exploited for an emotional assault (with little factual basis) on the Obama administration, and especially then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The violent attack on the embassy in Baghdad thus hit a nerve with the American public, and that’s something of which the Iranians are surely well aware. The sight of the demonstrators beating on the doors of the embassy compound and throwing burning objects over the wall surrounding it brought those old painful memories back.

Beyond the drama, which was broadcast live, the Iranians succeeded in turning the tables on Tuesday. For months, mass demonstrations against the Iraqi government have also been aimed at Tehran’s involvement on the country and its influence over the Iraqi leadership. In several cases, Iranian diplomatic offices in Iraq were even attacked. But now, the discussion has been diverted from Iran to focus on the last remnants of America’s military presence in Iraq.

Prior to the American airstrike on Sunday, which was widely denounced by Iraqi parties, a proposal was raised last summer in Iraq’s parliament to expel American soldiers from the country over airstrikes attributed to Israel in western Iraq (to which Iraqis suspected that Washington had given a green light). This proposal may now gain renewed support.

This is the moment of truth for U.S. strategy in the region. It’s impossible to know to what extent the Iranians planned this outcome in advance, but it’s clear they have gradually and calculatedly raised the risk level in a way that has now backed America into a corner and forced it to respond.

Some American analysts say Iran is in a panic, and this led to ill-considered steps by Tehran. But the opposite appears to be the case. Over the past year, it is Iran that has conducted a well-planned effort aimed at eventually easing American sanctions on it.

Israel is watching this crisis from the sidelines. Unfortunately, however, its political and military leadership have been spouting somewhat fatalistic statements in recent weeks about an impending clash between Israel and Iran on the northern front. Therefore, we must hope Jerusalem isn’t toying with the idea of indirectly adding fuel to the fire in Baghdad, in the hopes that this would lead to the formation of a new international coalition against Iran.

It's pretty much never a good idea to call out someone else's incorrect forecast in hindsight, especially if you're also in the business of prognosticating (or writing opinion columns). The reason: You'll almost surely be on the receiving end of ridicule yourself in the not-too-distant future.

This past year in fixed income, though, defies that rule of thumb. Since nearly everyone got at least something wrong, the entire bond-market community can look back and laugh at just how little they thought they knew about the stage of the credit cycle and the willingness of global central banks to abruptly change course and ease policy aggressively.

In 2019, every key US bond market posted positive returns, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data. A sample: High-grade corporate debt, 14.5 per cent; high yield, 14.3 per cent; Treasuries, 6.9 per cent; securitised products, 6.3 per cent; mortgage-backed securities, 6.2 per cent. Buying long-dated bonds in the aggregate index netted a profit of 20 per cent. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell to as low as 1.43 per cent, from 2.68 per cent, as the Federal Reserve embarked on back-to-back-to-back quarter-point interest-rate cuts in the second half of the year. Credit spreads are near the tightest they've been this economic cycle and the cost to protect against default is the lowest of the post-crisis era.

- Bank of America: ""We forecast the Fed will hike rates four times in 2019, reaching a terminal funds rate of 3.25-3.50 per cent by year-end.""

- Morgan Stanley: ""We believe the credit bear market, which likely began when IG spreads hit cycle tights in Feb. 2018, will continue in 2019, with HY and then eventually loans underperforming.""

- Deutsche Bank AG: ""Increasingly tight policy will push bond yields higher and lead to wider credit spreads after a near-term relief rally.""

- Nomura: ""We expect 2019 to conclude the hiking cycle with up to two more hikes. … IG is still in focus (especially the BBB story) but it's HY that could come under pressure as growth slows.""

- Citigroup: ""Both equities and bonds have the potential to see positive returns in 2019. However overall return levels are likely to remain subdued.""

- BlackRock: ""We see equities and bonds eking out positive returns in 2019. ... We take an up-in-quality stance in credit, and overall see limited upside and asymmetric downside as the economy enters into a late-cycle phase.""

- Pacific Investment Management: ""Cautious on generic corporate credit, but see relative value in financials and mortgages, modestly underweight duration.""

- Fidelity Investments: ""These are fertile conditions for complacency, and there is a real risk of inflation spiralling if central banks pull back from further monetary tightening.""

Bloomberg News's Mark Cudmore also admitted that he and the Markets Live team missed the great year for bonds: ""We never saw it coming."" He chalked up the miss to underappreciating what an intensified US-China trade war would mean for the global economic outlook and being caught off guard by the Fed's quick and nimble shift from raising interest rates to lowering them.

I agree with both of those culprits. Looking back, I was too convinced that Fed Chair Jerome Powell would hold policy steady through trade tensions to avoid the appearance of backstopping President Donald Trump's standoff with China. In late April, I wrote that bond traders went overboard on their rate-cut bets. In May, I still thought the Fed was committing to an aggressive pause, and in June I wrote that the market was seeing dovish signs that weren't necessarily there. Of course, the Fed dropped its lending benchmark by a quarter-point in July and did so again in September and October.

But aside from parsing Fedspeak, it's the following takeaway from Cudmore's retrospective that might be the most important of all, and why 2020 could most likely be another year of ever-shifting expectations:

""Perhaps the broader lesson from all our asset forecasts was a lack of ambition. We fell into the common trap of anchoring our predictions in today's ranges, and not realizing how far things could run once a move started.""

Across Wall Street, strategists are doing the exact same thing for 2020. Consider the 10-year Treasury yield for example, which is set to end 2019 around 1.9 per cent. Aside from outliers at Citigroup and Societe Generale, analysts at other primary dealers see the yield in a tight window of 1.5 per cent to 2.25 per cent in 12 months' time.

As for high-yield debt, analysts are forecasting a total return between 1 per cent and 7.5 per cent, which equates to fairly benign price swings given the securities' large interest payments. The median annual return on the Bloomberg Barclays high-yield index since 1984 is 7.5 per cent.

I wrote earlier this month about the bold call for 10-year yields from John Dunham. He sees inflation rapidly picking up in the first half of 2020, freaking out the Fed and forcing policymakers to raise interest rates again. Then, toward the end of the year, he sees the US tumbling into a recession. That's how the benchmark Treasury yield rises past 3% come September and drops to a record low 1.3 per cent by mid-2021.

Is that precise sequence of events - and ensuing wide price swings - likely to play out? I'm not so sure. It certainly stands in stark contrast to BlackRock's three overarching ideas for 2020: ""modestly positive on risk assets,"" ""neutral on global duration and cash"" and ""cautious cyclical rotation."" Don't get me wrong: Strategists at the world's biggest money manager have sound reasoning for those views. But they risk falling into the same trap that snared Wall Street in 2019.

One idea BlackRock and Dunham agree on: The risk of accelerating inflation is underappreciated in markets. That might be the one thing that could most quickly reverse 2019's bond boom. The median forecast of 61 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg calls for the 10-year US yield to end 2020 at 1.94 per cent, just about where it is today. If longer-term yields were forced to move higher in a hurry, that would cause a lot of pain across fixed-income assets.

The future, it turns out, is often quite difficult to predict. As the 2020s begin, perhaps it's best to borrow a page from the Fed's 2019 playbook: Take your best shot at forecasting the road ahead, but don't hesitate to react to important new information.

There's not much worse than coming to decorate the tree to find the fairy lights have become a huge knotted mess in storage.

But hours spend unravelling wires could be a thing of the past thanks to one woman's unique and frankly genius way of stopping them from tangling up.

Taking to social media, she revealed how using an empty Pringles tube can keep the lights neat and knot-free ready for next Christmas.

The woman posted her cheap and eco-friendly solution on the 1m-member Facebook group Extreme Coupling and Bargains UK.

In a discussion about tips for taking down Christmas decorations she wrote: “Discovered a bargain way to keep your lights untangled.

“I taped the lid on an empty tube of Pringles. Taped the end of the lights to one end. Wrapped the lights round as I took the lights off the tree.

“Taped the other end on. Works perfectly.”

The innovative idea was met with applause from other group members.

One fan said: Ohhhh that’s a good reason to go buy Pringles.”

Another added: “Pringles tubes are fab, I make a small hole in the lid to insert the plug.”

One wrote: ""Would love to see a video of it - I have 500 lights dreading taking them down.""

Not only is the trick handy, it also helps make use of waste product,as at present Pringles cans cannot be recycled along with other household waste.

After profiting from strong markets in 2019, investors are expecting 2020 to bring further rising asset prices and lively merger activity. But Brexit, the US presidential election and the US trade war with China could all spring nasty surprises over the next 12 months and give the long-running bull market a jolt.

The UK and Brexit

Relief that Brexit is resolved will be replaced by anxiety over the future relationship between Britain and the EU, with the transition period due to end in December 2020.

Dean Turner, a UK economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts UK GDP will only rise by 0.9% in 2020, even weaker than the 1.2% in 2019.

“It’s possible that there will be some bounce in activity given the clarity on Brexit, but any improvement in sentiment is likely to fade as the next Brexit deadline draws closer,” Turner says.

Ruth Lea, an economic adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, believes the UK will get a “fiscal boost” from the forthcoming budget, due in February. This could include an increase in the threshold for paying national insurance – in effect a tax cut.

“The economy has been facing the twin headwinds of Brexit uncertainty, which has almost certainly depressed business investment and could also have undermined the consumer, and the weaker global economy, especially in the eurozone. Having said that, there still seems to be growth,” Lea says.

The London stock market shrugged off Brexit anxiety during 2019 to post its best year since 2016. Several analysts predict it will rally in 2020 as relatively unloved UK shares are embraced by investors again.

Jeremy Podger, who manages Fidelity’s £2.7bn global special situations fund, says the City should benefit from the increased certainty created by the Conservative win in last month’s election.

“It appears to be the case that, in general, investors have been taking money out of the UK stock market since the referendum and that it is generally underrepresented in many international portfolios. This result could be a trigger for these investors to ‘neutralise’ their exposure while existing investors are unlikely to sell for now,” Podger explains.

But the prospect of fresh tough negotiations between London and Brussels over their future relationship will probably weigh heavily on sterling in 2020.

The UK could crash on to World Trade Organization trade rules in a year’s time if it cannot reach an agreement and refuses to extend the transition period. This would be “a significant step down from the current arrangement and an arrangement that investors fear will negatively impact the UK economy,” says Fiona Cincotta of City Index.

Takeovers in the UK

This year there could also be a rise in takeover activity. Jonathan Boyers, the head of mergers and acquisitions at KPMG, predicts a flurry of deals in the next six months now the UK has a stable government.

“Many of those who have been mulling over an exit have done their early prep work and are set to launch processes in the new year. Meanwhile, I expect there will be a significant amount of demand, keeping prices high, as the market makes up for some of the lost volume,” Boyers says.

Ben Higson, the head of the London corporate practice at law firm Hogan Lovells, also expects a “dynamic” mergers and acquisitions market in 2020.

“The removal of political uncertainty in the UK has resulted in early signs of confidence returning to deal-making activity, keeping boardrooms and other decision-makers busy in the final weeks of the year and, we expect, early in the new year,” says Higson.

Trump and US markets

Donald Trump’s attempt to win a second term is likely to dominate the headlines for much of the next 12 months.

Markets often do well in an election year – partly because the White House incumbent has every incentive to make people feel richer. Trump is rumoured to be considering a fiscal boost known as “tax cuts 2.0” which could lift his popularity, and stocks, before the November election.

Many investors have “priced in” a Trump re-election, says Edward Moya of the foreign exchange firm OANDA. A Republican win has been Wall Street’s “base case for a while”, so a Democratic win could startle the markets.

“Despite the strong economy, key battleground states such as Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania all have Biden leading Trump in recent polls. A Biden presidency would still be positive for US stocks but perhaps a few percentage points lower than a Trump victory,” Moya points out.

But if Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders were to beat Trump, tech stocks, banks and pharmaceuticals firms could all face tougher regulation, triggering a sell-off.

John Moore, a senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, says political concerns are already being priced into some stocks.

“Elizabeth Warren, for example, has made no secret of her feelings about Facebook and a desire to break up some of the other tech giants. Other candidates have targeted healthcare,” he points out.

On average, Wall Street strategists predict the S&P 500 will gain 5% in 2020, compared with a 28% rally in 2019.

Trade disputes

Trade tensions could escalate in 2020, particularly if the US intensifies pressure on Europe. Last month the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, criticised the “very unbalanced relationship” in trade across the Atlantic, signalling it was a White House priority for 2020.

Lighthizer’s comment “imparts a high risk of an escalation of tensions”, says Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services. He fears that a US-EU trade war would “inevitably” tip the German economy into recession.

The US economy is enjoying its longest expansion ever, having been growing for more than 10 years. Fears of a recession in 2019 proved unfounded, but the trade tensions stirred up by Trump are bad for growth.

“Trade tensions will continue to foster unpredictability in economic policymaking and cause a drag on demand and capital investment,” predicts Los Angeles-based Hercules Investments.

China and the US are due to sign their phase one trade deal this month. But there is a risk of this dispute flaring up again, leading to tariffs being reimposed on imports. That would have a chilling impact on the global economy.

China’s economy is also likely to keep cooling in 2020, having slowed to its slowest annual growth rate in three decades in 2019, at 6%. Beijing will keep trying to jumpstart growth in 2020, but Nariman Behravesh, the chief economist of IHS Markit, says China is fighting structural factors including an ageing population and weaker productivity growth.

“We predict China’s growth rate will slide even further, to 5.7% in 2020 and 5.6% in 2021, unless the government puts in place a more aggressive stimulus programme,” Behravesh says.

Markit also predicts that the US economy will grow by about 2.1% during 2020 – below the 3% targeted by Trump. Its manufacturing sector has slowed in recent months, but December’s jobs report did beat forecasts – an encouraging sign for Trump.

Central banks

Central banks will, once again, have a major impact on the financial markets – beyond their traditional remit of price stability. The US Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates on hold but could cut borrowing costs if economic data turns sour.

In Europe, Christine Lagarde is overseeing a review of the European Central Bank’s operations, with a new focus on the climate emergency. But she’s not expected to change the ECB’s dovish approach, so interest rates could remain at record lows for some time.

In the UK, interest rates could be cut if the UK economy fares badly once Brexit takes place on 31 January.

Bitcoin

In the cryptocurrency world, the major event will probably be a technical change that halves the reward for digitally mining bitcoins. This halving will probably take place in May, and is likely to reduce the supply of new bitcoins.

The two previous times when the block reward was halved, bitcoin rallied strongly afterwards.

“Bitcoin halvings are important events for traders because they reduce the number of new bitcoins being generated by the network. This limits the supply of new coins, so prices could rise if demand remains strong,” IG told clients.","The mood of the market turned quickly at the end of last year. Photo / Getty Images

The 2010s were a turbulent, transformative and testing time for the global economy but there was not a recession.

That is extremely rare. In fact, it is the first decade in the post-world war II era without a downturn in the UK and US.

A year ago many economists thought the global economy would be crawling over the line into the 2020s and would suffer a recession soon after.

• A recession will come, but how bad will it be?

• Jared Bernstein: Just how likely is a recession?

• Experts warn the next recession will be 'worse than the Great Depression' and predict it will hit US within two years

The trade war had escalated at a frightening pace, Brexit was in deadlock, global factories were heading into a deep industrial recession and central banks appeared to be oblivious to the threat of a downturn. The market's most-trusted recession signal - the US Treasury yield curve - then flashed red, predicting one within 24 months.

But the mood on markets has turned on a pinhead.

An ageing, and in some parts of the world record-long, economic cycle appears to have been given a shot in the arm. City forecasters have pencilled a slight acceleration in global growth from 2019's post-financial crisis low of 3pc to 3.1pc this year and 3.2pc in 2021. What changed?

The headwinds that threatened to tip the world into the next economic crisis have waned substantially. The US and China have reached an agreement for a ""phase one"" trade deal, potentially putting a pause on the protectionist wave sweeping the globe.

Boris Johnson's decisive victory in the election will not only get his Brexit deal over the line but gives him more wriggle room in the next stage of negotiations.

And crucially central banks have moved from tightening financial conditions to cutting interest rates and ploughing more money into markets.

The Federal Reserve, the US central bank, cut borrowing costs three times this year and moved from reversing quantitative easing - its bond-buying programme - to expanding its balance sheet again. The European Central Bank has also extended its experimental policies to revive growth, cutting rates deeper into negative territory and restarting its QE programme after an ill-conceived attempt to end it a year ago.

While many economists fret central banks will now not have the firepower to fight a recession if one does strike, the latest burst of stimulus has catapulted stock markets to new record highs. Global stocks have followed their worst year since the financial crisis in 2018 with their best, gaining 25 per cent last year.

But with growth still languishing at post-crisis lows, are investors sleepwalking into the next recession?

Most Wall Street analysts have predicted that the US-China breakthrough and the Fed's policy U-turn will be enough to stave off recession.

The US became the focus of recession jitters earlier this year given its importance to global growth. When America sneezes, the rest of the world still catches a cold - even as economic powers in the east rise.

However, Philip Marey, Rabobank's senior US strategist, warns the euphoria on markets over the trade deal has been ""overdone"", predicting the US will enter a recession in the second half of this year.

The deal struck by Beijing and the Trump administration picks the low-hanging fruit of agricultural products and rolling back tariffs but fails to tackle the key sticking points between the two countries, such as intellectual property.

Marey also argues that business investment remains low and the slack left in the US economy - the resources of an economy not being used - is very small, capping the room for growth. A key risk is that business worries feed through into the jobs market and hit the confidence of consumers, whose spending accounts for around 70 per cent of US GDP.

More rate cuts from the Fed would not be able to support growth further, he argues.

""It is really ineffective in supporting business investment and that is where the real bottleneck is at the moment,"" he says.

""For businesses, interest rates are low anyway so that is not their main concern.""

The US election in November will start to come into focus for investors, generating another source of uncertainty for businesses.

Signs of a recession brewing in the US could severely dent Donald Trump's chances given the strong economy is seen as stopping his approval rating sliding any lower.

Four more years of Trump will increase the risk of another trade standoff but some of his Democratic challengers are equally problematic for businesses and investors.

Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - who are currently polling in second and third place ahead of the Democratic primaries - are two leftist populists with plans to radically redistribute wealth and take on Wall Street.

Citi global chief economist Catherine Mann says uncertainty from trade and politics ""matters for the global economy"".

""The several risks that have been weighing on the global outlook have not dissipated, and there is a non-small probability that these intensify in 2020.""

While most investment banks believe the threat of an immediate downturn has been pushed back, she warns that the ""risk of recession still does loom over the economy"".

The relief from a prolonged and economically damaging period of uncertainty in the UK could also be brief.

Even with the Brexit deadlock broken, economists expect growth in the UK to be tepid again this year, slowing further from around 1.3 to 1.1 per cent.

With the prime minister insisting on a final trade deal with the EU being agreed before the end of the year, more uncertainty could plague businesses and the UK economy. No-deal Brexit worries could return in the second half of the year.

Berenberg UK economist Kallum Pickering is more optimistic, predicting that growth will hit 1.8 per cent this year after being boosted by the fiscal stimulus promised by the Conservatives.

""An orderly Brexit can lift confidence and spending in the next two years after more than three years of heightened uncertainty and gradually softening momentum,"" he says.

Economists expect much of the business investment lost over the last three years to return but estimates of how much can be lured back vary from around a quarter to a half. Some of the investment will be lost forever, however.

Torsten Bell, chief executive of think tank the Resolution Foundation, warns that Britain's buoyant jobs market could turn in 2020. This could weaken the economic boost provided by record employment levels and shoppers enjoying their biggest pay rises since the last recession.

""Our best guess is that 2020 will be very different from the last few years,"" Bell says. ""We may well see a welcome return to record pay levels, but a less welcome retreat from record employment, with worrying signs including falling vacancies and rising youth unemployment.""

Meanwhile the eurozone economy is expected to be weighed down again by Germany in 2020, with the impotent ECB unable to provide much stimulus and Northern European governments refusing to boost spending.

China, which has been hit hardest in the industrial recession triggered by the trade war, is also expected to slow further. City forecasters are predicting its growth will sink below the symbolic 6 per cent mark despite Beijing's huge fiscal and monetary stimulus efforts to pep up the economy.

While most economists believe a recession will now be avoided in 2020, the ability of policymakers and central bankers to revive growth is severely limited, if one does strike.

The world economy is facing at the very least a prolonged period of stubbornly slow growth that will be difficult to escape.

It’s too late at night. I could go for a run, but I worked hard today, so never mind.

I recently read that you should eat breakfast before you work out. Your body needs fuel. I really want to go for a run, but the thing is my run will actually be better if I eat a full English breakfast beforehand.

Wow, I just finished an incredible plate of eggs and beans. The time is right for a run, but running with a full stomach can lead to indigestion, so I’ll need to wait several weeks.

My phone says that it might rain in ten hours.

It’s windy.

It’s so cold, and I own a really soft fleece blanket. According to research from a team of Danish scientists, I should curl up under it instead of going for a run.

It’s so hot. A study by Swedish scientists concluded that running when it’s hot is bad. Yes, bad no matter what, even if you wear a hat or have one of those belts with tiny water bottles attached to it. I believe the study also said that those belts are confusing and make you look like a water officer.

I’m supposed to meet a friend in six hours. If I go for a run, I might enjoy it so much that I end up running for the full six hours. I’m a good friend and I don’t want to be late, so even though I would love to go for a run I will not.

I already took a shower today. If I go for a run, I will have to shower a second time, and that would use too much water. I care about the environment, so I will abstain from running.

I have no clean running clothes.

I have too many cute running outfits and I can’t choose which one to put on. Instead, I will continue to wear my nightgown.

I think I hear a parade outside. The people may need my running path, so I will cede it to them.

I think I hear a high-school track team outside. I will be generous and allow these worthy youths the use of the entire running path, even after they have left it.

I think I hear something crushing metal outside? Like, some kind of construction-related grinding?

Possible floods.

I might be getting sick. I’m not sick yet, but I’m getting that feeling in the back of my nose, where it transitions to the ring-a-ding section, also known as the uvula. Instead of running, I should really get into bed and let my immune system do its good, preventative work. I’m sorry, but that’s what I read in my self-published anti-running zine, “Simply Stay in Bed, Plus.”

There will be people with big dogs. I don’t have a problem with big dogs, but I like little dogs better and people usually take their little dogs for walks later in the day. At least, that’s what I’ve been noticing in my neighborhood. One of them even wears a denim jacket!

The little dogs used to come out at around five, but lately it’s been more like six, so I’m going to check my e-mail.

Actually, sometimes it’s more like seven.

Yikes, that was so much e-mail. Unfortunately, now it’s dark out, and running in the dark, as we all know, isn’t safe. Maybe I should go to the gym.

Oops, I forgot that the gym exposes me to germs and a spirited exercise community. For my health and emotional well-being, I regret that I cannot enter the gym.

The biggest legends in American baseball history all set records and achieved international fame playing with Louisville Slugger bats, the players’ names immortalized in the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory Hall of Fame in Kentucky.

But what about the men and women who worked in the factories, the artisans and engravers who produced their iconic bats for America’s favorite pastime? What were their names, and what were their stories?

Those are the questions being answered right now in Louisville, Kentucky. As part of the city’s biennial celebration, the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory dug out a trove of old photos, many black and white, from decades and decades of the company’s history. The pictures were a snapshot into not only the company’s past but of post-war American life. But many of the proud faces’ identities were unknown.

Ruby Judd worked at Louisville Slugger for 50 years filling ordered filling orders and doing quality inspection. She was identified by her niece, Laura Quiggins, who said: ‘She was very proud of her job, very proud of the product that they put out'

An unidentified man whittles down a baseball bat. In celebration of Louisville, Kentucky's biennial, the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory is hosting an exhibit that showcases vintage photos of employees that worked in the Hillerich and Bradsby factory over the years. A local campaign asked family, friends and former colleagues to help identify the nameless faces

A local campaign advertised the museum exhibit and showcased the photos in regional media. That’s when friends and colleagues of former workers began collaborating with the effort, and now many of those earnest, nameless faces have been identified.

‘Back in those days, people took such pride in their work,’ says Laura Quiggins, who identified her aunt, Ruby Judd, who was an inspector and order filler more than 50 years ago for Hillerich and Bradsby, the company which began manufacturing Louisville Slugger bats. ‘Nowadays, it’s like people just go to work to get the paycheck – “What’s in it for me?”

‘She was very proud of her job, very proud of the product that they put out,’ Quiggins tells DailyMail.com. ‘It’s so simple, but a little piece of wood made people famous, and those people made the bat famous.’

The effort came about when the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory was asked to participate in the Louisville Biennial, and curator Bailey Mazik thought of the photos she’d seen in archives and desks, folders of workers in the factories, men and women working for a company that began in 1856 and manufactured everything from butter churns to golf clubs to the famous bats – production of which began in 1884. The company receives information about former players on a daily basis, she says – but this was something new and special.

An unidentified employee is seen branding bats. Rena Jenkins, a longtime current employee who began at the company in 1977 instantly recognized a former employee by the name of Georgia Hines. She told DailyMail.com: '...she was a little bitty lady. She probably weighed maybe 110 pounds fully clothed...but she could engrave a bat. Back then, that was her job. She was the only one that did that back then'

‘One of our former vice presidents was kind of an amateur historian himself, so he collected a lot of these and organized these and wrote down a lot of employees’ names,’ Bailey Mazik says of Jack McGrath, who retired in the 80s.

She adds: ‘It has been important for us to know who these people are and to celebrate their hard work.’

One of those people was Quiggins’ Aunt Ruby.

‘She was an inspector and an order-filler,’ Quiggins tells DailyMail.com. ‘She inspected the bats and, when someone placed an order for them, she did the quality assurance … She had worked in several departments, because she was there for years.’

Aunt Ruby, who married and had two children, ‘loved her job,’ Quiggins says.

‘My grandfather worked with wood a lot and made things with wood, and he was a whittler. So she said going into work was like going into Dad’s house. She had built a big long 18-by-12 cedar closet in their house, so their house smelled like cedar – and she said that’s the only smell I don’t smell at work, is cedar. She smelled oak and all the other woods. She said it was a family-oriented place … Everybody knew everybody. She loved working there.

‘That was the place to work, back in the day. It was General Electric, Ford and Hillerich and Bradsby.’

The company has always been based in the Louisville region, and the Kentucky city has become almost synonymous with baseball bats. Tributes to players and their bats are included on a mile-long Walk of Fame through the city, and the Museum is easily identifiable by the world’s largest bat standing proudly outside of it.

Paula Dyer, another woman who identified her aunt and uncle – both Hillerich and Bradsby employees – echoed the sentiments of Ms Quiggins.

Hillerich and Bradsby was the ‘name I grew up with,’ she says. Her Aunt Polly and Uncle John ‘Buck’ Basham started in the 40s and retired in the 70s.

Buck was a WWII Army veteran, and Dyer’s mother and father had worked for Hillerich and Bradsby before leaving, helping her own parents get their jobs.

‘They would get up in the morning ... they were dedicated employees,’ Dyer says of Polly and Buck. They would get up at four in the morning; they would never be a minute late. They never missed a day.’

She adds: They were proud to work there, yes. It was hard work; they never complained too much about it. I remember, Uncle Buck, his hands would be stained.’

The Bashams were so proud, in fact, that they incorporated their company’s product into the cabin they built saving wages, she says.

‘It was a two-story cabin, beautiful cabin, and the stairs – instead of plain old rails on each step, it was a Hillerich and Bradsby baseball bat, she tells DailyMail.com. ‘And you know, none of us have pictures of it and it’s so sad.’

Uncle Buck died in 1976 at the age of 60 – only two years retired – and Aunt Polly passed away in 1999.

‘To be able to recognize them for their hard work and dedication ... I just love it,’ she says.

Rena Jenkins, a longtime current employee who began at the company in 1977 as an 18-year-old on the switchboard, helped identify former workers from the binders of folders such as Georgia Heins.

The effort to name and picture so many people excited her and made her happy to help, she tells DailyMail.com.

‘It is a legacy,’ she says. ‘It goes back so many generations ... I think they realize the history.’

She adds that she still believes the company makes ‘the greatest bat in the world’ and ‘it’s as American as apple pie.’

She’s worked everywhere within the company from accounts payable to shipping and purchasing and in the warehouses and factories, helping her get to know so many employees over the years who were equally proud of their work. One of them was Georgia Heins, who she recognized amongst the pictures.

‘She was real nice; she was a little bitty lady,’ she says. ‘She probably weighed maybe 110 pounds fully clothed and maybe with her pockets lined. She was 5’2, 5’1; she was a small woman, real skinny, but she could engrave a bat. Back then, that was her job. She was the only one that did that back then.'

She tells DailyMail.com that the company has always been ‘like a family.’

‘There was a lot of us that started young, so we were young and inexperienced. We learned off of some of the older ones, and we all started having babies and raising our families, and everybody was always here for everybody else.’

Many of the positions, she admits, ‘were tedious jobs – but they just had a little assembly line, and then you had a lot of husband and wives worked here. And then you had several that met their wives here and married.’

‘Years ago, whenever you had a baby, they used to send us a full-sized personalized bat with a letter from the president [of the company] saying: “Welcome to the Hillerich and Bradsby family.” And they would send us a personalized bat with the day they were born, their height, weight and all of that. So each of my kids have that.’

Archivist Mazik says that emphasis on connectivity and support has ‘been important and implemented in our company for as long as I can tell.

‘We all really make a point to know each other, all different departments, all different kinds of jobs. It has been really special to me to see how employees keep in touch with each other and how they take care of each other.’

The exhibit will run through the end of January, but Mazik hopes it can lead to even further historical research and memorialization of the people responsible for the building blocks of America’s favorite pastime.

‘I want to sit down with some of these folks, do formal oral histories that we can archive,’ she says.

Quiggins explained to DailyMail.com, '...it was a family-oriented place … Everybody knew everybody. She loved working there'","This is without a doubt my favorite day that rolls around every two weeks, and I’m not talking about payday (though that’s up there pretty high as well.) Today is the day that my housekeeper comes to rescue me from my own sloth, and I never get tired of it, or bored by repetition, even though it occurs every two weeks. (I’m calling her Ronda but that’s not her real name.) Author Erma Bombeck once said that cleaning your house while the kids were still growing is like sweeping your porch while it’s still snowing and I think that’s true, but I still look forward to it.

Here are the happy stages of “Ronda The Housekeeper Day:”

Stage One

Go to the ATM and get some cash, because my kids always suck up any excess I have lying around. I pay Ronda around $20 an hour, which I think is fair for five hours of manual labor cleaning my toilet and mopping my floors. Occasionally, someone will act surprised at this, and insist they can get me someone cheaper. “Gee, I know someone who will clean your whole house for $30!” Well, here’s the thing: I’m not interested in exploiting people just because they’re desperate and will work for less. Ronda came to this country from Guatemala (She’s in this country legally now so don’t send me any hate mail, thank you) as a mom deserted by her abusive, alcoholic husband. She left her boys with her mother and came up here to find a job to support them. At first, she told me, she worked for room and board only, which in my mind sounds an awful lot like slavery. Not the only time I’ve heard that kind of story, by the way. I pay her what I think is fair, and if you bargain your cleaning lady down to get her to scrub your floors for less, I probably wouldn’t like you.

Stage Two

Scurry around and put away anything that I think might get misplaced. Two women putting things away in the same kitchen is never a good thing. I spend a lot of time pacing and thinking, “Dang, where would she have put the measuring cups?” It’s just easier to put them away before she gets here. I usually throw a load of towels in the washer to give her a head start, since she does our linens. Sometimes I’ll wipe up the dog vomit or something else that’s particularly disgusting, though I’m not one of those people who cleans the house before the housekeeper arrives. I’ve always been a little confused by that concept. I know there are a lot of you out there, so please explain it to me.

Stage Three

Greet Ronda when she arrives, then vamoose as quickly as possible. I don’t want to be around while she’s cleaning for two reasons. First, because I can tell I’m getting in her way, though she would never say so. The second and more important reason is that I feel guilty. I feel vaguely ashamed that I’m making someone else clean the gunk out of my bathroom sink, even though I know she wants and needs the work.

Best-selling author Barbara Ehrenreich wrote a piece for Harper’s magazine back in 2000 called “Maid to Order: The politics of other women’s work” that I could never get completely out of my head. She went to work as a employee of one of those corporate housekeeping companies for the experience, so she could write about it from an informed perspective.

She wrote that people like to hire cleaning services, because they needn’t have a relationship with one person and watch her scrub their bathtub. Seriously, do you really think those maids are merry? Because I’m pretty sure they’re not. Some people also worry about theft, though I’ve never had a problem. One of my former housekeepers, who fled the death squads in El Salvador, had been a college professor there, and the only problem I had with her was letting her finish her work, because she was so interesting I always just wanted to talk. My mother was a neat freak who grew up an orphan in Texas, where in those days the difference between “white trash” and respectable folk was how clean they kept their houses. My mom could never abide the fact that her daughter was clearly trash.

Stage Four

Come home to a sparkling, lemon-scented house with freshly folded towels and clean sheets, enjoying an hour of pure bliss after walking through the door. At this point, I might think about how I really can’t afford a housekeeper, and wonder which kid I should get rid of so I can continue to hire her services.

Stage Five

It’s been 24 hours since Ronda was here, and I’m wondering how my house could possibly look so trashed. I also wonder why my son needs five towels for one shower and why he can’t pick them up off the floor. There’s nothing to be done but pine for her next visit. Ronda, please come back!",2.0,4.0,2.5,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.333333333333333," In celebration of Louisville, Kentucky's biennial, the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory is hosting an exhibit that showcases vintage photos of employees that worked in the Hillerich and Bradsby factory over the years .

In Australia, a million revellers thronged Sydney harbour and nearby districts to watch more than 100,000 fireworks explode above the city, even as thousands of people along the country’s eastern seaboard sought refuge from the bushfires on beaches.

Thousands in Hong Kong welcomed 2020 on neon-lit promenades in the picturesque Victoria Harbour, breaking into pro-democracy chants shortly after the countdown to midnight.

Hong Kong authorities cancelled the main midnight fireworks display for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns. A “Symphony of Lights” took place instead, involving projections on the city’s tallest skyscrapers, while smaller-scale pyrotechnics were launched from waterfront rooftops.

In Japan, people took turns striking Buddhist temple bells, in accordance with tradition.

Sydney decided to press ahead with its fireworks despite calls by some members of the public for the display to be cancelled in solidarity with fire-hit areas in New South Wales, of which the city is the capital.

Sydney Mayor Clover Moore said planning had begun 15 months ago and that the event also gave a boost to the economy.

Some towns in eastern Australia cancelled their New Year’s celebrations as naval vessels and military helicopters helped firefighters rescue people fleeing the fires, which have turned swathes of New South Wales into a raging furnace.

The fires have killed at least 11 people since October, two of them overnight into Tuesday, destroyed more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres) and left many towns and rural areas without electricity or mobile coverage.

Elsewhere, revellers from Auckland, New Zealand, to Pyongyang, the capital of isolated North Korea, welcomed the new year with fireworks displays.

But amid the celebrations of a new year and decade, old tensions threatened to flare up. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said on Wednesday his country would keep developing nuclear programmes and introduce a “new strategic weapon” in the near future, after the United States missed a year-end deadline to restart denuclearisation talks.

Protests, Brexit

In Hong Kong, rocked by months of sometimes violent pro-democracy demonstrations, protesters were urged to wear masks at a New Year rally called “Don’t forget 2019 - Persist in 2020,” according to social media posts.

Some 6,000 police were deployed and Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, appealed for calm and reconciliation in her New Year’s Eve video message.

The protests began in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, and have evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.

Thousands of Indians ushered in the year by demonstrating against a citizenship law they say will discriminate against Muslims and chip away at India’s secular Constitution.

The demonstrations came despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attempts to dampen protests that have run for nearly three weeks.

Irshad Alam, a 25-year-old resident of the Shaheen Bagh area of New Delhi, stood with his 1-year-old child in his arms and his wife by his side. He said he had been participating in the protest every day.

“It’s freezing here,” he said. “But we are still here because we care about this movement.”

More than three years after the UK voted to leave the European Union, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh from winning a parliamentary majority in last month’s election, promised in his New Year’s message to “get Brexit done before the end of this month.”

“As we say goodbye to 2019, we can also turn the page on the division, rancour and uncertainty which has dominated public life and held us back for far too long,” Johnson added.

In New York, large crowds were gathering ahead of the annual New Year’s Eve ball drop over Times Square.

I sit in one of the dives On Fifty-Second Street Uncertain and afraid As the clever hopes expire Of a low dishonest decade.

These are W.H. Auden's lines, written as the 1930s drew to a close and six years of global conflagration commenced. Eighty years later, they are pitifully, painfully apt as the second decade of our new century gives way to the third.

With 2019 staggering to its end, what do we see when we look back over the 2010s? What when we look forward to the 2020s? These are our questions, each to be answered without flinching, dissembling or deflecting.

It requires a wide-eyed Boy Scout's optimism to consider the decade now behind us and see anything other than a steady descent into global disorder, violence and abuse of international law. If this seems unduly pessimistic, it is merely because the 2010s were also a decade of probably unprecedented mis and disinformation, both deployed to mask responsibility for 10 years' worth of calamities that, with no obvious exceptions, could have been averted.

In this same line, you would have to be Hillary Clinton or Mickey Rooney, fresh from a rendition of ""Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" to miss the rampantly pernicious character of American foreign policy this past decade. The evident trajectory resembles what we find on the climate-change question: Amid copious signs of crisis, the U.S. spent the last 10 years hurtling in the wrong direction. By any measure, it is now very arguably the primary source of global disorder in this century.

U.S. as Major Planetary Threat

The world comes to understand this, even if many Americans prefer to bury themselves in illusions and self-deceptions.

A Pew Research Center study published earlier this year indicated that nearly half the planet now considers the U.S. ""a major threat"" to their nations. This is almost double the rate of negative views Pew found in 2013, when it began this series of surveys.

Two years ago, the Council on Foreign Relations convened a workshop of Europeans to consider ""Managing Global Disorder,"" as the event was titled. ""To some,"" CFR reported afterward, ""the principal source of instability has been the overzealous actions of the United States particularly in the wake of 9/11 in promoting democracy, human rights, and regime change around the world in contravention of established principles of state sovereignty.""

The good people at Pew seem intent on sanitizing the 2010s by dropping the blame for this rise in anti-American sentiment on Donald Trump's doorstep. The president certainly bears responsibility for souring the global mood, notably in pulling out of the Paris climate pact in 2017, the Iran nuclear accord a year later, and various arms-limitations agreements with Russia. But let us disabuse ourselves on one important point. The world's wariness and weariness of America's conduct beyond its shores was well in train before Mr. Trump went to Washington.

Bearer of Many Clever Hopes

Next Page 1 | 2 | 3","TOP 10: President Trump’s Biggest Accomplishments of 2019

Americans saw plenty of Washington at its worst this year, with one party in Congress obsessed with a partisan impeachment stunt and obstructing progress at every turn. But despite getting no help from the far left, America today is soaring to new heights.

It’s tough to pick only 10 accomplishments from such an extraordinary year, but here are just a few of the biggest things President Donald J. Trump has gotten done for the American people in 2019:

The Trump Boom is going strong. The unemployment rate recently hit its lowest mark in 50 years. All told, since President Trump’s election, our economy has added more than 7 million jobs—over half a million in manufacturing alone.

The stock market keeps breaking records: The Dow Jones and S&P 500 hit record closes again on Friday.

The working class is thriving, as are previously forgotten communities. Wages are now rising the fastest for low-income workers, and poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans have reached all-time lows.

Accountable government is back. Since taking office, President Trump has rolled back nearly 8 regulations for every new one, saving American taxpayers more than $50 billion in the process—with bigger savings still to come.

Better trade deals are putting America back in the driver’s seat. Congress approved President Trump’s USMCA this month—a huge win for U.S. workers, farmers, and manufacturers that will create 176,000 new jobs.

Trade with China, in particular, is about to get a whole lot fairer. As part of a historic “phase 1” deal, Beijing has agreed to structural reforms in its trade practices and to make substantial purchases of American agricultural products.

Securing the border is paying off and making our country safer. President Trump struck new agreements with Mexico and Central American countries this year to help stop the flood of illegal immigration. Thanks to this swift action, border apprehensions fell by more than 70 percent from May to November.

On health care, President Trump is fighting to give our patients the best system on Earth. While Democrats try to take away choice, the President’s focus on affordability led to the largest year-over-year drop in drug prices ever recorded.

American interests are taking center stage abroad. In just one example: After years of not paying their fair share, NATO Allies will have increased defense spending by $130 billion by the end of next year.

Our great military took out the world’s top terrorist in October. (Meet Conan, the hero dog who helped them do it!) Our troops are now getting the support they deserve. President Trump recently signed the National Defense Authorization Act for the 2020 fiscal year, which includes the biggest pay raise for our military in a decade.

208,239,Casino de Cuba: from Cuban tapas to cocktail masterclasses in the heart of Wigan,Mobile Jazz Cafe launching at Trinity Leeds selling coffee and cake from tuk-tuk,"An authentic Cuban restaurant in the heart of Wigan, Casino de Cuba offers everything from classic Cubano cocktails to distinct and unique Cuban tapas. Wrap that up in a warm atmosphere whilst also offering live sports, live music, and a shisha garden, and you can see why this particular locale promises to set the scene for an unbeatable night out.

Located just a few paces away from the home of Northern Soul, the old Wigan Casino - once named The Best Nightclub in the World by American Billboard Magazine - the restaurant is named in the casino’s honour.

The restaurant also serves Cuban gyros

“I’ve always been a people person, so the fact that the job gives you a chance to meet new people in the town centre on a daily basis is something which I like,” said General Manager Josh Smith, 25. “We get to know loads of good people what with us being a small business. I enjoy my work.”

Restaurant Manager Kyle O’Dowd, 22, agrees. “Making sure people are happy and that they leave with a smile on their face means I can go home and sleep well,” said Kyle, who is from Leeds and who has worked at the restaurant for six months. “We’ve got a good team, they’re a good bunch.”

With the menu proffering meals such as steak gyros, tacos, nachos, and paella as well as thick burgers and an assortment of steaks, Casino de Cuba - which has around 25 staff members - also offers cocktail masterclasses.

“I worked my way up from starting two years ago and took over as manager in Spring, so putting together a team has been a challenge which I have really enjoyed,” said Josh, from Ashton-in-Makerfield. “I’ve liked assembling the team and we’ve got to the stage now where we click.

From Cuba Libre to daiquiris...

“When you’ve got a team you really relish working with, it makes the job a lot easier.”","The café will launch inside the BLK BOX retail concept, a pioneering shopping experience based around revolving retail, art and avant garde independent brands.

Shoppers can enjoy coffee and sweet treats from the tuk-tuk when they visit the ground floor space at Trinity Leeds from January 9.

Owner Greg Gallaghar, who launched his café at Leeds Food & Drink Festival in July 2019, said he is excited to grow his business at BLK BOX.

209,240,Taylor Swift And Ryan Seacrest Under Fire On Twitter — Twisting Nicki Minaj’s Words Gone Wrong,Wellington City Council unsure how cycle lane just inches wide happened,"Taylor Swift and Ryan Seacrest seem to have jumped into a flame they weren’t quite prepared to overtake. Amid Nicki Minaj’s tweets, they’ve somehow twisted her words. But fans and non-fans aren’t standing for it.

In a previous Inquisitr article, it mentioned Nicki Minaj‘s VMAs rant and how some things may have been taken out of context. Well, it appears that several people were affected by Minaj’s words — but not by what she said. Rather, it came indirectly because of who responded.

Of course, it started with Taylor Swift‘s response to one of Nicki’s tweets, as can be seen in the previous article. However, it progressed once Ryan Seacrest made a tweet about the topic. The on-air personality poorly worded a headline.

Then, several Twitter users lit into the personality.

And several others were directed at him. However, Taylor didn’t escape the onslaught. Fans believe she wanted to make the topic about her, rather than focus on what Nicki’s words suggested.

nicki was making valid points about the history of racism in the music industry, taylor should be standing by her not making it about her — becca (@margaerytyreII) July 21, 2015

Nicki Minaj responded to Ryan Seacrest’s headline as well.

Nothing I said had to do with Taylor. So what jabs? White media and their tactics. So sad. That’s what they want. https://t.co/AfcwoyDvpg — NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) July 21, 2015

Ryan posted a headline of Taylor saying she loves & supports me. But not me saying the same to her. Lol. Their headline says I took a “jab”? — NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) July 21, 2015

I’m so glad u guys get to see how this stuff works. Taylor took her music off spotify and was applauded. We launched Tidal & were dragged. — NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) July 21, 2015

Sometimes, it’s difficult to recant statements after they’ve been made, especially after people see those statements. This shows evident proof, does it not? What do you think about it all?

Did they intentionally twist Nicki Minaj’s words and switch the focus? Do you agree or disagree with the majority’s thoughts about it all? Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments section below.

The council said it would send engineers to take a look, unsure if it was responsible or not.

210,241,"A Quiet Place 2 Trailer Arrives, Here Come the Monsters",Trailer To John Krasinski’s “A Quiet Place: Part II”,"Paramount Pictures has revealed the first full-length trailer for A Quiet Place 2. The studio had previously revealed a brief teaser that offered a tiny glimpse of what's to come in the sequel to 2018's inventive horror hit. This, however, offers a much more thorough look at what the studio has cooked up, with most of the core cast returning to once again face down the horrors of this post-apocalyptic, silent wasteland. But the horrors aren't limited to deadly, sound-seeking monsters this time around.

The initial A Quite Place 2 teaser trailer picked up following the events of the first movie. John Krasinski's character gave his life to protect his children, ultimately making it so they could survive with their mother. The family managed to figure out a way to kill the beasts that have invaded Earth, which gave them a leg-up in the survival game. However, as we can see, they are having to step off the sandy path that had kept them safe for so long and will be forced to head into uncharted territory. Emily Blunt is back as the head of the Abbott family, with Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe also returning as her children.

John Krasinksi, who directed and co-wrote the original, returns to the director's chair this time around. Krasinski also wrote the screenplay. Original writers Scott Beck and Bryan Woods stepped back to focus on original endeavors but remain involved in a more limited capacity. New cast members include Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins) and Djimon Hounsou (Captain Marvel). Details regarding any characters were being kept under tight lock and key during production.

A Quiet Place 2 picks up following the deadly events of the first movie. The Abbott family is forced to face the terrors of the outside world as they continue their fight for survival in silence. As they hesitantly journey into the unknown, they quickly realize that the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats that lurk beyond the sand path. Allyson Seeger, Joann Perritano and Aaron Janus, Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller serve as producers.

Released in 2018, A Quiet Place went on to become one of the most unexpected hits of the year. The movie was embraced widely by critics, currently boasting a 95 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences agreed and moviegoers turned up in droves to see it. The movie, working from a relatively modest budget of just $17 million, went on to gross $340 million at the global box office. With that, a sequel became a top priority for the studio. The question is, was this a lightning in a bottle situation? Or can they manage to strike gold twice? A Quiet Place 2 is set to hit theaters on March 20, 2020, from Paramount Pictures. Be sure to check out the new trailer for yourself.","Paramount Pictures has now released the official trailer from John Krasinski’s “A Quiet Place Part II”.

Rabat – The public prosecutor at the Marrakech Court of First Instance has formally appealed the decision of the investigating judge to grant Moroccan singer Dounia Batma and her sister provisional release on bail.

An investigating judge ordered the release of Dounia and her sister on bail after their indictment for alleged involvement in the “Hamza mon bb” case.

The Hamza mon bb case involves accounts active on social media on Snapchat and Instagram, posting videos and photos about celebrities and influencers for blackmail.

The prosecutor at the court of appeal has contested the court’s decision to release Dounia and Ibtissam Batma on bail.

The singer and her sister paid MAD 500,000 each to be released during the ongoing investigation.

They could both face to five years in prison if convicted.

National judicial police in Marrakech transferred Dounia Batma and her sister Ibtissam to the Public Prosecutor in Marrakech for further investigation on Monday, December 30.

The Batma sisters are not allowed to leave Moroccan territory before the end of the investigation while the investigation remains ongoing.

Police also seized Dounia’s phone, currently subject to technical examinations to determine any links between the two sisters and the Hamza mon bb case.","Moroccan singer Dounia Batma was heard, Monday, by the King’s prosecutor in Marrakech and then brought before the investigating judge over alleged involvement in blackmail.

Last week, Dounia Batma, who rose to fame as the runner-up of the first season of Arab Idol, had her passport and cell phone seized by the police as soon as she arrived in Morocco, Le360 reported.

On Thursday, she was interrogated for 12 hours by the National Brigade of the Judicial Police (BNPJ) in Casablanca as part of an investigation into the «Hamza mon bb» case. «She was also formally notified that she is banned from leaving the country», well-informed sources said.

As Northern Ireland greets 2020, just a year shy of the centenary of the foundation of the state, there will be many who hope DUP leader Arlene Foster means to deliver on her new year message of making the province a place at peace with itself and which the majority of people, unionist and nationalist, can feel comfortable in.

That is the greatest guarantee Northern Ireland's future within the Union is secure. Unionists, who have never learned from what they term as past betrayals by the Westminster government, is feeling nervous. They recognise that demographics are against them and the toxic atmosphere generated by Brexit in particular has created an increased groundswell to test opinion on Irish unity.

Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald wants a border poll but there is widespread agreement that it would be a divisive move at a time when Northern Ireland's more pressing day-to-day problems need sorting out.

Whatever one says, the ideological divide is always there between the two big parties.

But as they and the other local politicians return to talks tomorrow they know that public opinion demands they find a compromise and return to work at Stormont.

The problems that should unite them far outweigh the demands that divide them.

While Mrs Foster is correct to point out that civic and business life has soldiered on heroically during the three years that politicians have abdicated their responsibilities, it cannot be denied that the underlying problems in public services are at crisis point.","Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney DUP leader Arlene Foster

Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney has called for a ""new beginning"" as talks to restore power-sharing resume tomorrow at Stormont.

DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party aimed to secure a ""fair and balanced"" deal.

The parties have just 11 days to reach a compromise. Secretary of State Julian Smith has warned that he will call a fresh Assembly election if an agreement hasn't been brokered by then.

Rather than winding down for the festive period, the staff and judges at Truro Crown Court have had an extremely busy December dealing with a huge number of serious cases.

Many criminals have been given huge sentences ensuring that this Christmas isn't the only one they'll spend behind bars.

Cornwall is certainly a better place without some of these criminals walking our streets over the festive period.

Here are the criminals sentenced at Truro Crown Court in December

Michael Barber

A racist menace was jailed for a spree of offending that included attacking shop workers, verbally abusing police officers and launching the most sickening tirade of racist abuse at an innocent man he encountered at a railway station.

Michael Barber, 33, told the man at the train station that he should go back to Africa and the cotton fields before spitting in his face.

Barber, of no fixed abode, appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after admitting two common assaults, twice making malicious communications and racially aggravated assault, all occurring in June and July of this year.

The offences also put him in breach of a community order handed to him for two sexual assaults.

Prosecuting the case, Ian Graham, told the court how Barber entered the Co-Op store in Truro .

He began to swear at the cashier and was asked to leave by a member of staff.

As the member of staff walked him to the door drunk Barber headbutted him in the nose before punching another intervening member of staff in the face.

Barber was eventually wrestled to the floor and restrained before police arrived.

Then, some days later, a police call handler took a call from Barber who was asking for an ambulance claiming he’d taken an overdose.

When asked his name he replied “Jesus Christ” before proceeding to verbally abuse the call handler, making a series of vile and personal insults including saying that he’d “f*ck his mother”.

Barber followed this up by leaving a sweary voicemail on a female PC’s answer phone when he made similar remarks.

Then, most seriously of all, Barber encountered a man at Penzance Railway Station and called him a n*gger whilst speaking on the phone.

Mr Graham described how the victim then approached the defendant and asked him what he said, Barber replying “sorry mate, I called you a n*gger, the whole of Cornwall are racists”.

Mr Graham said: “The victim then ignored Mr Barber by playing games on his phone but the defendant said ‘why don’t you go back to your cotton fields’.

“The defendant then said ‘why did you come here from Africa’ and when rail staff became involved made further comments about cotton fields and said that he was a better rapper than the victim.

“The victim told him he made him feel sick and Mr Barber then spat at him, laughing as he did so saying ‘that’s exactly how you make me feel’.”

The court was then told how Barber attempted to punch and kick the victim but was held back by staff.

Briefly addressing the sexual assaults for which he received a community order, Mr Graham outlined how drunk Barber twice touched the breast of and tried to kiss a 76-year-old woman who tried to look after him at the Greenbank Community Church in Liskeard .

Sentencing Barber, Judge Robert Linford said: “You are 33 and have many, many convictions recorded against you over many years for offences of being drunk and disorderly, threatening behaviour and common assault.

“They all stem from homelessness and addiction but the time has come when a therapeutic approach to sentencing has to stop. The National Probation Service has tried and failed to help you.”

Barber then appeared to shake his head at which point Judge Linford stormed out before returning and slamming Barber for “the most appalling tirade of racial abuse it is possible to imagine”.

An irritated Judge Linford then jailed Barber for 14 months for all of the offending.

He was also made subject of a five year criminal behaviour order banning him from being in possession of an open container of alcohol in Cornwall and being found in a state of drunkenness in the county.

Kane Powell

A judge told a prolific offender that he had reached the end of the line as he jailed him on his 22 birthday.

Kane Powell found himself in the dock at Truro Crown Court for a third time in two years, this time for his role in disorder at an organisation that helps young people facing difficulties in their lives.

Powell, of Higher Fore Street, Redruth , was given non-custodial sentences previously for racially abusing and attacking a taxi driver and then damaging a stranger’s car .

Powell returned to the court to be sentenced after previously admitting using threatening or abusive words or behaviour, putting him in breach of a suspended sentence.

Prosecuting the case, Michael Brown said: “On October 23 at 7pm officers were called to attend Redruth Foyer due to reports of a disturbance involving a number of individuals and the defendant was seen kicking a door.

“He was told to stay away but two hours later he returned and was again asked to leave. This time he was swearing and spitting and told officers to f*ck off as well as making other threats.”

Sentencing Powell, Judge Simon Carr said: “On November 20 2018 you were sentenced for a range of offences. These offences were serious and involved the possession of a knife, racially aggravated threats of violent and battery.

“Offences like these usually attract a custodial sentence but the court took a chance on you hoping you would address your issues. You would have no doubt been told this was your last chance.

“Your reaction was to breach this order by being drunk and committed criminal damage. In April this year you were given another chance but have now reached the end of the line. Those who breach suspended sentence don’t get repeated chances.”

Judge Carr did concede that Powell has made progress in some respects and that the recent offence was less serious, but proceeded to jail him for four months and give him a £150 fine.

Brian Parsonage

A former teacher and researcher stabbed his wife of 29 years with such force the knife remained lodged in her arm.

Brian Parsonage exploded in a huge fit of rage on September 30 after a row about money, not long after he had been made redundant.

Parsonage, 60, of Commercial Road in Hayle , appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after admitting causing grievous bodily harm and possession of a knife.

Prosecuting the case, Ed Bailey, said that Parsonage had never laid a finger on his wife until the day in question but had turned to drink after losing his job.

Detailing events, Mr Bailey said: “Christine Parsonage was angered at the defendant for wasting money and when she realised he’d been drinking an argument flared up.

“The defendant later told police he drank half a bottle of vodka neat and when words were exchange between him and his wife, he went to the kitchen and Mrs Parsonage saw a folding knife in his hands.

“He came at her with the knife and jabbed at her arm and she instinctively raised her arm to defend herself. Such was the force of the blow that the knife went into the side of the victim’s forearm.

“He said to her ‘I hate you, I really hate you, I want to kill you’. The defendant then throttled her and pushed her into the dining room.

“The knife remained sticking into her arm and after some time Mr Parsonage pulled it out and grabbed her by the throat again.”

Mrs Parsonage, afraid for her life, was eventually able to escape and sought refuge at a nearby vets, whereas Mr Parsonage took himself to Hayle Police Station and handed himself in.

The victim was left scared to return to her own home and now wishes to leave Cornwall completely.

Sentencing Parsonage, Judge Simon Carr said: “The circumstances behind this case are truly sad. You and the victim were married for 29 years and had a daughter together.

“Finances were tight and one way you dealt with that was to drink to excess which you did on this day.

“There was an argument with your wife over the fact you’d been drinking and you took a knife and stabbed her with sufficient force that the knife penetrated her arm and lodged there.

“You continued to be verbally abusive, attacking her and holding her against a wall.

“The effect on your wife has been obvious. She is severely traumatised and was so scared she not only left the house, but now intends to leave Cornwall.

“You are 60, a man of previous impeccable character and have dedicated your life to education and that’s why I described it as a truly sad case.”

Parsonage was sentenced to 18 months in prison and made subject of a restraining order preventing him from contacting his wife.

Jack Conway Baker

A gambling addict was jailed for a scam in which he created fake profiles and sold sexy pictures to two men before blackmailing them out of £14,000.

Jack Conway Baker, 23, initiated contact under the name Courtney Hall and then got in contact pretending to be Courtney’s older brother, repeatedly and menacingly demanding money from the two ashamed men saying that if they didn’t pay up he’d tell their friends, family and work about their online activities.

Conway Baker of Trevingey Road in Redruth , appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after admitting two blackmail charges.

Prosecuting the case, Philip Lee told the court how in April 2017 the first victim was feeling low after being signed off work due to medical reasons.

He was contacted online by a person saying their name was Courtney Hall and agreed to buy naked pictures from her.

He bought the first set of pictures for £50, before buying more, eventually spending over £300.

Mr Lee said: “The victim then received a Snapchat message reporting to be from Courtney’s brother saying she was underage and that he would tell their parents and the police unless the money was paid.

“He agreed to pay £1,000 and then received further demands via Snapchat and other forms of social media.”

Conway Baker then became increasingly menacing with his threats, saying he’d found the victim’s address and contacted his work place.

Even in August 2017 when he told his parents, the threats continued and he received one message claiming to be from a police officer (really it was Conway Baker), saying if he paid a sum of money the case would be closed.

The first victim paid Conway Baker a total of £7,500 and was left suffering from stress and anxiety.

Also throughout 2017, Conway Baker used the Courtney Hall profile to trap a second victim after meeting him on Tinder.

After the initial payment for a naked picture, the threats followed with up to 30 messages a day being received by the victim demanding money.

The second victim paid Conway Baker £6,495 and was left embarrassed and in financial difficulties.

Sentencing Conway Baker, Judge Simon Carr said: “You developed a gambling addiction and needed money to fund it.

“You set up a fake internet identity called Courtney Hall who was by the pictures you used in her late teens or early 20s.

“It was clear from the information she was willing to sell pictures to those willing to pay and the two victims found that profile, one on Tinder, one elsewhere.

“They agreed to pay for pictures and once they had a couple of times you appeared demanding money. You threatened them, saying unless they paid significant amounts of money you’d to go the police, their family or work colleagues.

“You reiterated these demands with threats of violence, saying you knew their home and work address. You even took on the persona of a police officer.

“This was a plot of some sophistication and the threats were repeated and persistent.

“Both men felt embarrassed. One paid £7,500 and the other £6,000 to buy your silence. Each time they paid you came back and demanded money.”

Judge Carr jailed Conway Baker for three years and told him he must compensate the victims for the amounts they paid him.

Marcus McPherson

A “dangerous and violent sexual predator” was given a huge prison sentence after years of criminality against young girls eventually caught up with him.

Marcus McPherson, still only 21, targeted young girls online and violently sexually assaulted two of his victims after eventually persuading them to meet.

McPherson, of Dunveth Road in Wadebridge , appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after admitting sexual assault, assault by penetration, distributing an indecent image of a child, three counts of meeting a child following sexual grooming, engaging in sexual communication with a child and two breaches of a sexual risk order.

Opening the case, Philip Lee told the court how McPherson’s crimes came to light after a lengthy investigation.

Mr Lee describing how “four victims were identified and willing to help police with their investigation”.

Moving onto the offences against the first victim, Mr Lee described how she met the defendant in 2015 when she was 14 and he was 17.

Mr Lee described “persistent and demanding messages” in which he requested sexual chat and photos and also sent pictures of his penis to the girl.

In November 2015 she went to meet a friend at a bus stop in Lanivet and agreed the defendant could come along. When they were alone McPherson pushed the girl back and tried to unbutton her trousers and zip.

He then held her head with one hand and continued trying to undress her with the other, saying it was ‘what happened to people who said no’.

The second victim, of a similar age to the first, was again bombarded with sexual messages by McPherson and eventually agreed to meet him in Par in 2017.

He took a train there and they went to the skate park and then into the woods to take shelter from rain.

When there he put her arms around her so she couldn’t move and his hand inside her top, touching her breasts.

He then put his hand inside her underwear and abused her in such a way she was left in pain. When she told McPherson to back off he still persisted saying ‘let me do it, it’ll feel really nice’.

Chillingly, Mr Lee said after the ordeal McPherson continued to message her and blackmailed her into sending him a naked photograph, warning if she didn’t he’d tell everyone what happened. The girl sent him the picture but he then distributed it to others leading to her receiving comments and abuse.

The third victim, aged 13, was contacted by McPherson when he was 19 and sent thousands of messages, many of a sexual nature that included videos of him masturbating to the point of ejaculation.

The girl did meet McPherson but only when others were present, meaning no contact offences took place.

Then, in September 2018, McPherson contacted a young girl on Instagram saying he was 16.

Mr Lee said: “Conversation was normal at first but when it moved from Instagram to Snapchat it became sexual and the defendant sent pictures of his penis and videos of him masturbating.”

While the investigation was progressing McPherson was made subject of a sexual risk order which he repeatedly breached by being found with social media apps on his phone. One breach was reported by a girl he knew from school who he contacted and in turn told police as she was aware of his situation.

The girls McPherson physically abused were said to have suffered physically and emotionally as a result of his offending, going on to have problems with their education and with self-harm.

Sentencing McPherson, Judge Simon Carr said: “Such was the concern of the authorities about your behaviour that in 2018 they obtained a sexual risk order. They are rare and awarded by magistrates even before a criminal offence is proved.

“It was a result of this investigation and obtaining the order that officers were able to look at your devices and this revealed a catalogue of offending.

“It started when you were 17 in 2015 and the offending against each of the four victims followed a similar course.”

Judge Carr described how the girls were bombarded with a barrage of messages.

Detailing the attack on the first victim, Judge Carr said he was convinced that McPherson thrived off not just the sexual aspect but the violence he exerted too.

Moving onto the offence against the second victim, Judge Carr said that the manner of the penetration showed he intended to inflict maximum physical pain.

Judge Carr added: “The effects of what you did were devastating and the victims relive what they experienced on a daily basis. They quite wrongly blame themselves and have self-harmed and found it difficult to form relationships.

“You are a dangerous and violent sexual predator and I suspect you will be for the rest of your life.”

Judge Carr sentenced McPherson to an extended sentence of 14 years, nine years custodial and five on licence. He will only be eligible for parole after two thirds of the custodial element.

He was also made subject of a sexual harm prevention order and must sign the sex offenders’ register for life.

Philip Chalker

A man threatened police officers with a knife after they were called following a huge row when his partner found out he was seeing another woman.

Phillip Chalker, 44, was said in court to have a severe dislike of the police and vowed to kill every one of the officers who attended the scene.

Chalker, of Colinsey Road in Penzance , appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after admitting affray.

Prosecuting the case, Philip Lee told the court how in the late afternoon of October 13 three callers contacted police summoning them to the defendant’s address.

Mr Lee said: “When police arrived they found Deborah (the defendant’s wife), with an injury to her face.

“The defendant emerged from the front of the house shouting abuse and making threats, saying to police ‘if you come into the house I’ll kill you’.

“Officers tried to reason but the defendant continued with the abuse and threats. He then threw something out of the upstairs window and shouted ‘stay away from my house of I’ll stab you, I’ll cut you up’.”

Chalker then ran into the garden with the kitchen knife in hand.

Mr Lee added: “He then shouted at officers ‘get that taser away, I’ll kill every one of you’. He went back inside and there was the sound of smashing glass. Eventually he came out and did comply with the officers.”

The court heard how in 2014 Chalker was sentenced for an almost identical set of offending, also occurring at his home and involving the waving of a knife.

Sentencing Chalker, Judge Simon Carr said that the ordeal occurred in broad daylight and must have been frightening for those who witnessed it.

He added that his previous non-custodial sentence for a similar incident did nothing to deter him and that those who threaten police officers with knives can expect nothing but jail.

Chalker was jailed for 15 months.

John Williams

A pervy pensioner caught by paedophile hunters engaging in internet sex chats with who he believed to be 12 and 13-year-old girls was sent to prison.

John Franklyn Williams, 71, of Leskinnick Place in Penzance, was door-knocked by members of the group Hunters 24/7 who had travelled nearly 350 miles to question him after conversations with their decoy profiles.

Williams went on trial at Truro Crown Court on Monday charged with two counts of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity and two of attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child charges.

Following a short period of deliberation a jury rubbished Williams’ account that he knew all along they were paedophile hunters and was playing along to call them out, convicting him of all four charges.

Prosecuting the case, Paul Grumbar said: “On September 22, 2017, police received a call asking them to attend a property in Penzance.

(Image: Hunters 24/7)

“When police arrived they were met by a man wearing a jumper which had Hunters 24/7 written on it.

“The people at the address were members of a paedophile hunters group who explained to the officers that female adults had been communicating with the defendant over the internet pretending to be young girls and that the defendant engaged with them with sexually explicit messages.

“They explained that they were filming a live stream of their interactions with the defendant. The defendant was then arrested on suspicion of child grooming offences and taken to the police station.

“The messages between the defendant and the two decoys was retrieved and it is clear and obvious that he was obtaining sexual gratification from them.”

During the trial the jury was then showed the Hunters 24/7 video in which they explain to Williams that they’ve travelled 347 miles to see him and that he was talking to decoys he believed to be real girls aged 12 and 13.

The hunters describe that Williams told the decoys that he wanted to have sex with them, asking what difference age makes.

He also nicknamed his penis and the girls’ genitals during chats and asked them questions about their underwear, urging them to send him pictures and videos.

Judge Simon Carr jailed Williams for 21 months.

Dale Laidlaw



Police have welcomed a sentence handed down to a prolific shoplifter and burglar saying it acts as reassurance to the public.

Dale Laidlaw, 30, was sentenced to three and a half years in prison at Truro Crown Court for a series of burglaries and thefts across Cornwall .

Laidlaw, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to three counts of commercial and four counts of residential burglaries.

A further 22 offences that hadn’t yet reached the crown court were taken into consideration by Judge Simon Carr as he passed sentence after being admitted by Laidlaw.

Investigating officers DC David Squire welcomed the sentence.

He said: “Laidlaw is a prolific offender, carrying out many of his burglaries at residential addresses across Bodmin , stealing money, jewellery, electronic items and much more.

“We are pleased with the sentence outcome and hope this reassures the public that police do take a proactive stance on these types of offences.

“We work tirelessly to ensure that, where possible, justice is served.

“I would like to acknowledge the good police work carried out by CID, Neighbourhood and Response teams and Scenes of Crime officers in bringing this person to justice.

“We would like to thank the public who contacted us following our previous appeals for information on social media. Such information proved vital in this person’s conviction.”

Jake Campbell

A notorious thug had six months added to his sentence for another unprovoked episode of violence.

There was jubilation in the Bodmin area in October when Jacob Campbell, 26, was finally put behind bars .

In August prolific criminal Jake Campbell was given four months to save himself from prison when sentenced for headbutting, choking and punching Jacob Comertoglu as he made his way through Bodmin to see the town’s Christmas lights last year.

Campbell got his suspended jail sentence deferred by the judge after he launched a ferocious beating that left his 19-year-old victim’s face swollen and bruised. A picture of Jacob Comertoglu’s injuries was shared by his mother, causing outrage across Cornwall.

After calls from the victim’s mum and others for action, Campbell, 26, was eventually arrested and admitted a charge of assault when he appeared at Bodmin Magistrates’ Court .

Passing sentence at Truro Crown Court , Judge Robert Linford told Campbell, of Wallace Road in Bodmin , that he’d be given one final throw of the dice, deferring sentence until December.

Campbell was told that if he kept out of trouble, saved money towards compensation and kept his appointments he’d avoid a prison sentence. However it took him less than three weeks to blow the chance.

He found himself back in the dock for an offence of being drunk and disorderly outside The White Hart Inn.

Judge Linford jailed Campbell for 14 months to take into account a wounding suspended sentence and the common assault.

Then, on December 19 he was back before Judge Linford, this time after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

Prosecuting the case, Althea Brooks said: “On October 20 this year at about 9:15pm Sean Flynn was walking from his parents’ house with his partner Donna Martin.

“They were walking past the entrance to McColl’s when a man asked to borrow ID to buy alcohol. Mr Flynn said no and kept walking but the man continued to ask.

“He became agitated and hostile and pinned Mr Flynn to the wall. It was at this point the man was joined by the defendant and together they took him to the floor and kicked him numerous times in the head and stomach with one witness hearing the impact.”

Campbell was also aggressive to officers on arrest and Mr Flynn was left with numerous injuries including memory loss which still affect his sleep and work.

Sentencing Campbell yet again, Judge Linford said: “I remember you very well. You were a person I took a chance on and you threw it back in my face.

“This offence is another offence of violence and you launched an unprovoked attack on someone doing nothing wrong at all. It was appalling and outrageous.”

Campbell was given a new sentence of six months to be served on consecutively to the sentence he is already serving ensuring he will remain behind bars even longer.","Sign up to FREE daily email alerts from liverpoolecho - daily Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email

At Christmas we're all guilty of over-indulging on the delicious food and drink on offer.

It's more than likely we'll have put on a few pounds over the festive season and could be regretting that last sausage roll at the buffet.

With a New Year starting many of us will be making a resolution to shape up and lose some excess weight, so for some inspiration we decided to take a look back at some super slimmers, who've done just that.

In 2019 many people shared their weight loss success with us, so we decided to share some of the most inspiring stories, to kick start your resolutions.

Here's some of the most amazing weight loss transformations of 2019 as they explain just how they did it.

1. Obese mum who got stuck on Centre Parc slide

A mum-of-two swore to lose weight after getting wedged on a water rapids ride in Center Parcs.

The embarrassing experience was enough to motivate Sue Wilson to transform her 20.3st body.

And in just 22 months, the Marks and Spencer section manager has lost a whopping 8st.

(Image: COPY MEDIA)

Sue from Aintree always started the day with egg and sausage on toast or a full fried English breakfast.

For lunch she would eat sandwiches with crisps and chocolate, followed by more sweet treats and sometimes even a whole rotisserie chicken with skin on a barm cake.

However, Sue's gorging didn't stop there, for dinner should either have pizza or an Indian takeaway with a rich and creamy sauce.

But during a holiday in 2017, Sue was speeding down the Wild Water Rapids ride in Center Parcs, when she came to a sudden stop and found herself wedged halfway down.

(Image: COPY MEDIA)

She said: ""Everyone was looking at me from the observation area and I tried to shove myself down but I was wedged firmly in.

""I could see kids coming screeching down behind me and I totally blocked their path. It took four youngsters slamming in behind me one after the other before they managed to push me through.

""I was so embarrassed; especially when we got off and the kids said to ‘hurry up or that fat one’s going to beat us and block us again’ - I never went back in.""

Joining Slimming World in April 2017, Sue had a complete diet overhaul.

Starting with a healthy breakfast of fruit, Sue moved on to having a salad for lunch and a homemade burger and chips for dinner - made the Slimming World way.

After her weight loss Sue even made a trip back to Center Parcs, saying: I couldn’t wait to get back down the Rapids ride, and this time nothing and no-one was going to stop me - especially not my weight.”

2. Jon who lost 20 stone

Jon Vidler used to tip the scales at 33st 12lbs, but after shedding 20st 7lbs even his own family struggle to recognise him.

Jon, 42, was named as Slimming World’s Greatest Loser 2019, and can now buy medium-sized clothes after cutting his 66 inch waist in half.

Jon said: ""I feel I have a second chance.

""I want to fill it with things I missed out on due to being so heavy. Meeting someone special would be amazing.""

Before his weight loss Jon could barely stand for more than a few minutes and was prone to panic attacks caused by worrying about his weight.

He would eat takeaways, huge bowls of sugary cereal and mountains of sweets and chocolate on a daily basis.

Those and other health scares drove him to join a friend at a Slimming World group in Hampshire.

Jon saw his weight plummet after being inspired to eat healthily and take up walking.

Jon now eats meals made from scratch the Slimming World way, lots of fruit and homemade healthy cooked breakfasts.

3. Paul who downed seven pints a day sheds 14 stone after revelation in Benidorm

A man who thought nothing of downing seven pints a night has lost over 14 stone after suffering a shock revelation in Benidorm.

Paul Aitchison , 59, from Toxteth, had a huge appetite and his love of a pint down at the pub saw his weight slowly creep up over the years.

A fan of a full English, Paul tipped the scales at 28st 13lbs thanks to his excessive eating that didn’t stop after breakfast.

He said: “I’d have butties on white bread for lunch – and lots of them – with ham, or cheese or corned beef on.

(Image: Copy Media)

“And I’d always have cake and biscuits afterwards, easily going through at least a packet of biscuits a day.

“For tea, we’d usually go down the chippy and have a curry or a steak with loads of chips.""

The turning point came when Paul and Pam, went on holiday to Benidorm and couldn’t make it up to the short hill to their holiday hotel.

Paul said: “My sister and her husband had booked the hotel and we had no idea it was at the top of a hill before we went.

“I was horrified when I saw it because there was no way I could easily walk up, especially in the Spanish heat.

“Just attempting it left me sweating and breathless – so, in the end, we left my sister and her husband to climb the hill – and Pam and I gave up and got in a taxi.

“I was so big then, I couldn’t even bend down to tie my shoelaces and so that, and the hotel hill, made me realise I had to do something about it.”

By the time Paul weighed in at Slimming World in August two years ago, he had managed to lose one stone by himself, but he still tipped the scales at 28st 13lbs.

(Image: Copy Media)

But a healthy diet and a new food regime has seen Paul go from 29st 13lb at his heaviest to 15st 11½lbs.

Paul said: ""I changed the fried breakfast for Weetabix with skimmed milk and I’ll have sandwiches on brown bread for lunch or, sometimes, I’ll just have fruit.

“I’ve stopped going to the chippy now and I do all the cooking for me and Pam, and I enjoy doing it. So now it’s a healthy stew or a casserole, or chicken or steak with vegetables.""

4. Liverpool FC fan shed five stone to play football with his son

A Liverpool FC fan shed five stone in an incredible transformation - and it was all so he could play football with his little boy.

Kevin Derbyshire, 32, from Anfield, started hitting the gym two years ago when he found out he would soon be a dad to baby Harlen.

Tipping the scales at 17 stone, the 32-year-old said his weight left him feeling ""too embarrassed to take his top off and look in the mirror.""

(Image: Kevin Derbyshire)

Kevin said: ""I'd just eat anything. I was eating the wrong things, like chocolate instead of fruit and I didn't eat any veg.

""When my little boy came along I didn't want to be overweight for him.

But after building up the confidence to walk through the doors of a gym, Kevin went on to lose more than five stone.

Kevin, who works as a bus driver for Arriva, has now slimmed down to under 12 stone.

(Image: Kevin Derbyshire)

He said: ""It's about doing that little bit even if it's just 20 minutes a day it will make a difference.

""I eat things now that are going to fill me up the same but that are also going to be a lot more beneficial, instead of chocolate and crisps.""

5. Benidorm barmaid who ate 6am chips every day sheds 13 stone along with sister

Two sisters who do ‘everything’ together shed 13 stone between them after ditching their chippies and kebabs.

Toni Fitzgerald, 28, and her older sister Rachel, 33, both from Dingle, said they both had a huge appetite for take-aways and saw their weight creep up over the years.

Rache said : “I would sit there and eat pasta with loads of cheese piled on it.

“I wouldn’t eat much in the day but it got to 3pm and then I would eat, I’d come home and have kebabs or five pieces of toast at once.”

Toni also gorged on unhealthy food while she was living in Benidorm and working at a nightclub.

She said: “I would have a chippy all the time and fast food because I was finishing work at 6am because I worked in a nightclub called Hippodrome in Benidorm.""

It was New Year’s Day in 2016 that Rachel decided she had enough of feeling depressed about her weight and needed to do something about it.

Her little sister, Toni saw how well she was doing and was also “so unhappy” about her weight that she decided to join the group while still in Spain.

Rachel said: “It was New Year’s Day 2016 and I was so depressed and sad.

“You know how everyone says ‘new year, new me’ I really wanted it, so decided to join Slimming World again.”

Sister Toni added: “I was living in Spain and was so unhappy about my weight and when my sister started Slimming World I couldn’t believe how well she was doing.

“So I joined in Spain and we helped each other - we used to Facetime every single day about our food and what we're eating.

“Then when I came home for good me and my sister went to the gym together and we take dogs for walks and we do everything together.”

Rachel went onto lose eight stone, while Toni shed an incredible five.

The pair said they feel so much happier and confident after their weight loss and “love going clothes shopping now.”

6. Mum who struggled to breathe going upstairs sheds six stone

A mum who struggled to breathe going upstairs decided to change her life by shedding six stone in a matter of months.

Helen Rooke, from Childwall , said she now has her confidence back and feels amazing after she swapped takeaways and oven chips for homemade pizzas and chocolate Weetabix.

With a family wedding and her daughter's Holy Communion on the horizon, the mum-of-two joined her local Slimming World group last January, and by August 2018 she had said goodbye to her size 26 clothes.

In just eight months, Helen had gone from 20st 5lbs to 14st 5lbs.

Now a slinky size 14, she said: ""I have got so much more confidence now.

""It is so nice that I can go into shops and get fashionable clothing that fit me. I can just go to the rail and they have my size.""

""I have also started going swimming - something I did not have the confidence for before my weight loss.""

Helen's diet before included skipping breakfast and loading on easy 'grab-and-go' prepared foods.

But now, she cooks nearly every meal from scratch, she said: ""I can still have foods I love, just with simple changes - like swapping out white bread for brown.""

7. Mum thought she would die before Christmas if she didn't lose weight

A 31-year-old mum who weighed a staggering 30 stone feared she would die before Christmas if she didn't lose weight.

Laura Cain, from Southport , gorged on takeaways and scoffed her way through bread, barm cakes, butter, and chocolate, alongside cups of tea every day.

But after tipping the scales at a whopping 30 stone her seven-year-old son inspired her to lose weight so they could ""enjoy a longer life together"".

Laura, who went to school at Stanley High School in Southport, swapped her unhealthy ways and transformed her lifestyle.

Instead of fatty foods Laura now enjoys grape nuts or Weetabix for breakfast, tuna with salad or jacket potato for lunch Slimming World meals for tea.

And now the mum has lost a third of her body weight - trimming down to an impressive 19 stone and seven pounds.

The mum said: “I could still eat badly if I wanted too, but I don't. I stick to food optimising with Slimming World. I attend group every Wednesday for the love and support and amazing tips I get there.

(Image: Laura Cain)

“I know I have haters out there who say I am cheating because I have had weight loss surgery but in fact no - it is just a tool to help me.

“I have just been awarded my 10 stone award and I am now in the 19 stone bracket! I can't remember the last time I was in the teens bracket.""

8. Mum sheds half her bodyweight after not being able to get up for loo

A mum-of-four lost half her body weight after she couldn't get up out of a chair to use the loo.

Janet Lewis weighed 22 stone at her heaviest, but she's shrunk to 10 stone 10lb after joining a slimming group in July 2017.

Janet, 53, says she knew things needed to change when her partner had to help her out of the chair to go to the loo.

(Image: Janet Lewis)

She said: ""I couldn't carry my own body weight, so my partner had to help me to the toilet.

""I was crying that I was going to wet myself. That was the turning point for me.""

The death of her father, coupled with the embarrassment of being unable to support her own body weight, drove her to join Slimming World.

She said her consultant Rob Phillips was a real driving force in her quest to get slim - and stay that way.

(Image: Janet Lewis)

Janet said: ""Rob never gives up on me. Even when I come back from holiday and put on some weight, I prove to him that I can get it off again.

""My motto is to 'eat myself slim'. I make sure I stick to the Slimming World food optimisation plan by making loads of food myself, including homemade KFC and cheese burgers with bacon.

""And my children love my Chinese food.""

9. Dad loses ten stone after being too large for Alton Towers ride

A dad managed to lose half his body weight after being shamed into shedding the pounds when he was too fat for an Alton Towers ride.



Blake Lewis, 33, who tipped the scales at 23 stone, was left mortified when he was told he was too big to ride the theme park attraction with his young daughter.

He had been visiting the Staffordshire theme park with his wife Laura, 35, and their children Sophie, five, and Toby, six, on May 29 last year.

But as Blake went to climb aboard the Go Jetters Vroomster Zoom roundabout-style ride in CBeebies Land he found the the safety bar wouldn't fit over his belly.

The embarrassment led to Blake going on a diet and in just under 18 months, he lost an impressive 10 stone - dropping from a 40 inch waist size to 32.

Incredibly, Blake did not join any weight loss groups and managed to reach 12-and-a-half stone all by himself as a result of healthy eating and regular exercise.

He said: ""I saw myself as addicted to junk food, mainly savoury things like pies, burgers, fries, and crisps.

""Now if I see a pork pie I'm not bothered but before I thought: 'I've got to have it.'

""It's all about will power, being disciplined and cutting out the rubbish.

""Every Sunday I'd prepare healthy meals and freeze them or put them in the fridge.

""When I'd come home hungry I'd have one instead of burger and chips.

""I've never been healthier.""

10. Man who devoured mountains of toast after 'messy divorce' sheds four stone

A minister who used to munch mountains of toast for breakfast managed to shed four and a half stone after his ""messy divorce"".

Malcolm Fife would scoff a fry-up every morning and said his lunches ""always involved chips"" when his weight ballooned.

The 66-year-old, who is a minister at the United Reform Church in Newton-le-Willows , tipped the scales at 17 stone at his heaviest weight.

But he had a wake-up call when a doctor said he could develop Type 2 Diabetes because of his bulging frame.

Malcolm puts his incredible transformation down to Weight Watchers, which helped him lose between five and six pounds in a single week.

Malcolm said: ""I joined just as the new Flex programme was being launched, this has since become WW Freestyle as WW and settled in to following the plan.

""I have found no problem with the loss in weight as I started to eat more fruit and veg, making good use of the 200 zero point foods available.

(Image: Malcolm Fife)

""I have continued to lose weight and am now maintaining the weight loss that I have made.""

Malcolm said the change on the scale, down to 12st 7lbs, has been so dramatic that when he visited a church in Nottingham after two years, people did not recognise him.

215,246,I'm Optimistic For The Market In 2020. Here's Why...,"Small, Easy Habits You Can Pick Up In 2020","The stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, gained nearly 30% this year. It was truly an incredible run.

The last time we saw this sort of return was 2013, when the market ended the year up 29.6%.

Here's a bar chart of S&P 500 returns over the last 30 years so you can see how 2019 stacks up to past performances.

However you look at it, this has been quite a year. But you might be surprised to learn that this wonderful year for the stock market has been ""hated"" by investors...

You see, typically when we have a good month or year investors pour more money into the stock market. For instance, in 2017 stocks returned a superb 19%. Investors, not wanting to miss out on future returns, poured $54.2 billion into stocks in the first month of 2018. That's the largest monthly inflow in years.

The same holds true when the market is falling...

You might recall that this time last year the S&P 500 was in freefall. It fell as much as 15% in the month of December alone. Investors were scared. They yanked $57.4 billion from equities during that last month of 2018.

In short, when the market is doing good, investors typically put more money to work. When the market turns sour, they pull money out.

So, I found it quite astonishing when I looked up what investors had done with their money this year -- a fantastic year for the stock market.

Turns out, they're getting out of stocks.

According to data from the Investment Company Institute, investors have pulled more than $196 billion out of their stock funds (stock ETFs and stock mutual funds) this year. This is the second-largest outflow from stock funds on record.

The largest outflow came in 2008, when investors jerked more than $200 billion out of their stock funds. As I'm sure you recall, that was about the worst year to be an investor in generations. Every asset class fell... a lot.

Why Fear Is Great News

Again, when the market is on a tear, we normally expect investors to pour money into stocks. When the market is crashing, we expect massive outflows.

So what's going on? I think it can be summed up in one word: fear.

Despite the meteoric rise of the market, investors have been pulling their money out of the stock market. Fear is the only reason you'd do that. In fact, investors haven't been this ""scared"" since 2008.

Had you decided to go against the crowd in 2008 and buy the S&P 500 starting in January 2009 you would be up a whopping 258% since then.

Of course, I have no idea what the markets will deliver in 2020 or the year after that, or where it will be in 10 years. But it seems that after so many years of incredible returns investors are still skittish.

That's great news for stock investors. It tells me that we could continue to see wonderful gains from the market. Investor sentiment isn't at euphoric levels, yet.

And if history is any guide, bull markets usually die shortly after a euphoric stage. If anything, you should be greatly concerned that a big market plunge will happen soon if everybody in the market is euphoric.

The fact that we're not there means we should see the momentum from 2019 carry over into 2020. And we should be prepared to continue riding this wave.

But before we do, I want to wish you all a happy New Year. Here's to a prosperous 2020.

2019: A new normal

In 2019, temperature records — both lows and highs — were set in Windsor and the surrounding area. In some cases, heat warnings were issued too soon, resulting in mixed messages from Environment Canada and the municipality.

Ice cover continued to decrease on the Great Lakes, increasing coastal erosion problems. Experts said the Great Lakes will ""bounce back"" and have shown resilience year-after-year.

This year, Windsor also joined a Red Cross pilot program on flood preparation education.

2018: 'Eerie' funnel clouds, tornados

(Submitted by Janis Stammler)

In July 2018, ""eerie"" funnel clouds were spotted in the area — for three days in a row. Funnel clouds were photographed in Lakeshore, Tecumseh, parts of Chatham-Kent and in south Windsor.

In September 2018, three tornadoes touched down in southwestern Ontario, including McGregor, Comber and Amherstburg. It took until the end of October 2018 for Environment Canada to confirm the tornadoes, while municipal officials defended not issuing public warnings.

2017: Record rainfall causes 'Code Orange,' strands motorists

Devonshire Mall was closed Aug. 29, 2017 after a one-day record rainfall dropped 54.7mm of rain on Windsor. The hospital declared a 'Code Orange' and motorists abandoned their vehicles in flooded streets.

Radar estimates showed that as much as 140mm of rain landed on the Tecumseh area, while just 14mm of rain fell on Harrow.

2016: Drought-like conditions cause problems for farms, trees

Some Essex County farmers spent the summer of 2016 wishing for rain as drought-like conditions reminiscent of 1988 caused stress. Following the record-setting June rainfalls from the year before, farmers said they wanted a ""normal year"" but weren't sure what that was anymore.

The drought — Windsor received only 13 millimetres of rain that August — also caused leaves on trees to change colour and fall off. Environmentalists blamed that on the lack of rainfall.

2015: Superbowl snowstorm

On Feb. 1, 2015 — Superbowl Sunday — the biggest storm of the winter in Ontario slammed into southwestern parts of the province, with more than 40 centimetres of snow falling between Windsor and Hamilton.

2014: A snowless December

2014 was the coldest year on record in Windsor, with an average temperature of 8.2 C. However, no measurable amounts of snow fell in Windsor in December 2014 — the first time since 1943.

On the other hand, November 2014 broke snowfall records. About 10 times more snow fell in November 2014 than it did in November 2013.

An August deluge also battered Windsor in 2014, with a 10-hour storm dropping 70 millimetres of rain on the city in one day. Just a week later, another storm brought two EF0 tornadoes to the region.

2013: Windsorites head to Toronto to help with ice storm aftermath

Tens of thousands of people spent Christmas 2013 in the dark after an ice storm knocked out power in large parts of Ontario and Quebec.

Disaster management volunteers for the Red Cross from Windsor went into more battered parts of Ontario to help residents dig out from the deep freeze.

2012: Ten straight days of 20 degree weather

Across North America, temperatures in March 2012 were unlike any year before. The long-lasting intense heat eclipsed every previous record.

In Windsor, there were 10 straight days with temperatures above 20 C.

All four seasons in 2011 broke records, with wild ups and downs. From the snowiest year on record to summer temperatures so hot you could cook on the dashboard of a car, 2011 had it all.

It rained so much, Amherstburg residents threatened to sue the town for not stopping their basements from flooding.

2010: More than half of Ontario's tornadoes hit in Windsor-Essex

Ontario's seasons in 2010 weren't extreme on their own, but more than half the tornadoes this year landed in the Windsor-Essex region.

On June 6, 2010, a series of tornadoes tracked through Essex County — up to F2 intensities — and a state of emergency was declared.

About 15,000 people went without electricity for days and the event cost about $100 million in insured losses.

More tornadoes ravaged Midland, Ont. later that month, with a fifth Essex County tornado landing in Amherstburg in July.","KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WATE) — With the 2010s now in the rearview mirror, we’re looking back at the big news and sports stories in East Tennessee that helped shape the decade.

Below are the WATE 6 On Your Side Decade in Review videos – featuring file content from our coverage of some of the major news stories in our region; as well as the news briefs to coincide with the video clips.

Decade in Review Part 1 (2010-2015)

2010

Knoxville’s top story saw a local leader step up to the state level with then-mayor Bill Haslam, who was elected to become the Governor of Tennessee.

2011

A shake-up for South Knoxville kicked off 2011, with the closure of the Henley Bridge.

Plus, history was made for Knoxville’s top office – Daniel Brown became the city’s first black mayor, as interim leader after Haslam became governor. Then, Madeline Rogero became the city’s first female mayor.

2012

It was upheaval for the criminal justice system in Knox County as Judge Richard Baumgartner found himself on the wrong side of the law; admitting to addiction to painkillers, which created questions about judgment in major cases including the Christian-Newsom murder trials.

2013

Heads turned the day after Tax Day, April 15, 2013, with federal agents at the headquarters of Pilot Flying J. Federal court documents revealed how the company executives worked to cheat customers by “jacking the discount.” Pilot Flying J would go on to pay nearly $200 million in settlements and penalties.

2014

A crash on Asheville Highway shocked our community and renewed calls for change: One school bus swerved over a concrete median, crashing into the side of another school bus. The investigation revealed distracted driving to be the cause. The incident prompted a review of the district’s transportation program – penalties were stiffened for bus drivers caught texting, but calls to require seat belts on school buses did not bring a change to state law.

2015

This year tragically saw a teen hero’s ultimate sacrifice. Fifteen-year-old Zaevion Dobson was killed while shielding two friends from gunfire. The Fulton High School football player’s death would get national attention: His sacrifice was mentioned by then-President of the United States, Barack Obama in a speech urging more gun control.

Zaevion’s mother, Zenobia Dobson, urged the community for change and for healing.

Decade in Review Part 2 (2016-2019)

2016

It was years in the making – the Battle at Bristol, transforming Bristol Motor Speedway into a football stadium. More than 160,000 fans came out, which was the biggest crows to see a college football game. The Vols claimed the victory, 45-24.

In June, sports fans across the nation mourned the loss of Pat Summitt after her fight with Alzheimer’s.

In November was a tragedy the the community with never forget — wildfire spread across Sevier County, killing 14 people and scorching homes and businesses. From that, an outpouring of support helped by homegrown superstar local Dolly Parton.

2017

People around the area turned their gaze skyward as parts of East Tennessee had the perfect vantage point the see a total solar eclipse.

The year also brought chaos to UT Athletics with the firing of Coach Butch Jones and fans revolting against the hiring of Greg Schiano. The university’s reputation took a nose-dive in the national press. Then, then-athletics director John Currie was replaced by legendary former Vols Football Coach Phillip Fulmer.

2018

The year brought political transitions with Tim Burchett’s term limited as Knox County Mayor. In a squeaker of an election, former pro-wrestler Glenn Jacobs won the primary and went on to win the general to become the county’s new mayor.

Congressman Jimmy Duncan had announced the year before he wasn’t running for re-election, marking the end of a political dynasty. He had held the seat since the 1980s; before that, it was his father’s seat since the 1960s.

Tim Burchett and fellow Republicans like Jimmy Matlock made the primary one of the hottest area races in a long time. Burchett won in the primary and the general – heading to Washington, D.C. in his Carhartt jacket as the new congressman for District 2.

2019

Knoxville voters kept political history rolling – electing Indya Kincannon as the city’s second female mayor, plus a majority female city council.

Also, a youngster bullied for his DIY Vols T-shirt went viral; embraced by the Orange & White Nation – the shirt was recreated by a local business to sell at the VolShop and went on to raise nearly $1 million for the STOMP Out Bullying organization.

Dollywood also celebrated the launch of Wildwood Grove, the park’s biggest expansion, as Dolly herself seemed to be everywhere — she was also the subject of a popular NPR podcast and her songbook the center of a hit Netflix series, “Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings.”

217,248,Texas A&M University workshop focuses on electrical power infrastructure in Qatar,Ooredoo launches New Year offers for Shahry and Qatarna customers,"QNA

A two-day workshop organised by electrical engineering faculty at Texas A&M University at Qatar brought together experts and practitioners from the United States, Europe and Qatar to focus on ensuring delivery of electric power in Qatar safely and reliably.

Presented in partnership with VITO Middle East and Energyville, with funding support from the Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF), the Workshop on Safe and Reliable Electrical Distribution Systems for Qatar shared best practices, lessons learned and new technologies that are ready for application to enhance the safety and reliability of the electricity distribution systems in Qatar.

Workshop chair and associate professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Program at Texas A&M at Qatar Dr. Robert S. Balog , said that most of the electrical distribution system in Qatar is relatively new, certainly compared with US and European systems where there are well-known problems due to the aging infrastructure. But as solar energy becomes more widespread and electric vehicles gain traction, what will happen here in Qatar when equipment ages or is pushed beyond its intended design

The workshop aimed to leverage expertise at Texas A&M at Qatar and VITO to identify potential problems and develop paths and partnerships to form and implement Qatar-specific solutions.

However, Balog said, more work may be needed to customize these technologies into solutions specific for Qatar, thereby necessitating a research ecosystem built around technology transfer to industry and the design, development, deployment and service of these technologies.

Dean of Texas A&M at Qatar, Dr. Cesar Octavio Malave, said, “Texas A&M at Qatar is proud to have a strong partnership with academic institutions and local industry, as well as several government entities.

Our mission is to play a key role in creating sustainable solutions to real-world challenges by generating new knowledge through research and collaborative partnerships, and then disseminating that knowledge to the rest of the world through scientific publications and workshops such as this one.

Texas A&M at Qatar is committed to expanding the human capital of the State of Qatar that is essential to fuel innovation and new thinking.”
